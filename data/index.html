            <li><b>Ratboys - Singin’ to an Empty Chair</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 88]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Blends Americana/indie rock with descriptions of emotional depth and compositional advancement, fitting the criteria for artistic value and innovation.</i></span></li><li><b>Moon Mother - Meadowlands</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 88]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The description highlights emotional depth, speaking of 'anguish, grief, and trauma, while also crafting a sense of wonder, peace, and a smidge of hope'. It also hints at artistic intentionality by mentioning the artist's ability to 'create your vision with what you have, and let the negative space do the work for you', which suggests a unique and thoughtful approach to music creation, aligning with artistic value.</i></span></li><li><b>Mary Jennings - Pyrotechnicolor</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 82]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Despite being labeled Pop, the description 'fully formed emotional reckoning' of songs written over a decade, described as 'intimate yet cinematic, personal yet eerily,' points to significant emotional depth and artistic merit that transcends typical pop, aligning with the user's preference for meaningful music.</i></span></li><li><b>Sophie Gault - UNHINGED</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 80]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The description, 'sounds like it was cut with the venue’s back door still propped open. You can hear traffic. You can smell the bourbon. Somebody’s laughing a little too loud and nobody’s apologizing for it,' strongly suggests a raw, authentic, and unpolished sound. This directly counters your avoidance of 'highly processed and engineered music' and hints at an artistic challenge and emotional depth, reminiscent of artists like Tom Waits or Nick Cave.</i></span></li><li><b>Daniel Alspach - Round & Round</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 80]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: While hip hop is an occasional preference, the description 'late-night cruiser... built for empty roads, glowing dashboards, and thoughts that just won’t sit still,' and 'airy, almost haunting' implies an introspective and moody quality, suggesting artistic depth and merit beyond commercial rap.</i></span></li>

        <h2 class="review">🤔 Not Added but Worth Browsing (8)</h2>
        <p>These albums scored 70-79. They didn't make the playlist but might be interesting.</p>
        <ul class="review">
            <li><b>Ryo Fukui - Mellow Dream</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as a 'soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator' with an 'epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold,' this suggests significant artistic depth and challenge within jazz, a genre you occasionally enjoy. The term 'smooth' is noted but outweighed by 'innovator' and 'epic' characteristics.</i></span></li><li><b>Erin Rose - Wildfire</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Although labeled Pop, the description 'shaky fault line,' 'leans straight into the heat,' and capturing specific moments of 'thrill, the fear' indicates emotional depth and a thematic exploration beyond generic pop, warranting a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Black Hurst - Purgatory of Flesh Bizarre</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The album is described as 'NYC heavy metal-infused black metal', which is a direct match for your preferred extreme metal genres. While 'thoroughly enjoyable debut' is somewhat generic praise, the specific genre fusion makes it worth a manual review for artistic merit.</i></span></li><li><b>Slipknot - Look Outside Your Window</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Slipknot is an artist in a relevant genre (nu-metal/extreme metal adjacent). While the description as a 'long-awaited project' indicates significance, it lacks strong artistic keywords like innovation or emotional depth. It mentions being recorded during a past album session, which might not be 'new musical ideas,' but the artist's genre makes it worth a manual check.</i></span></li><li><b>Pythonic - Decomposition</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Describes a fusion of Metalcore, Hardcore, Groove Metal, and Heavy Metal, genres you enjoy. The 'impressive approach' and blending of styles suggest some artistic merit, but the description lacks the stronger 'innovation' terms for a higher score.</i></span></li><li><b>The Unfamiliars? - Bottles</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Pop-punk genre is acceptable. The description 'nostalgic, bittersweet' suggests some emotional depth, aligning with a desire for music with artistic value, though not explicitly indicating innovation or artistic challenge.</i></span></li><li><b>DJ Druskin - Sittin’ in the Garden</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Folk-pop is acceptable. The themes of 'stillness,' 'quietly radiant,' and drawing from 'forced rest and recovery' suggest introspection and emotional depth, aligning with the user's preference for music with artistic merit, though not necessarily groundbreaking.</i></span></li><li><b>Liqueedo - English Rose</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Indie genre is acceptable, and 'wistful romance' suggests some emotional content. However, 'shimmering melodies' and '1980s pop' influence could lean towards generic pop, requiring manual review to ensure it avoids highly processed or purely commercial sounds.</i></span></li>
