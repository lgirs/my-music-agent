But there\u2019s real complexity in creating something that feels effortless\u2014distilling a song idea down to its core, making it lyrically accessible, and setting it to a melody that\u2019s both immediate and unforgettable. Tyler-James Kelly did exactly that on his solo debut, and he continues that success [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Country , Videos Tagged With: Tyler-James Kelly Now & Then: Natalie Del Carmen\u2019s\u00a0Pastures\u00a0and the reach of\u00a0Our Endless Numbered Days Sunday, February 08, 2026 By Tom Osborne Los Angeles is not exactly famous for quiet. It\u2019s famous for traffic that hums in B-flat and palm trees that look like they\u2019re always posing for a headshot. So when a 24-year-old songwriter from L.A. drops an Americana record called\u00a0Pastures, the first surprise is the title. The second surprise is that it actually sounds like one: open air, creaky wood, and time moving at a human speed.

Pop/R&B Do You Still Love Me? Ella Mai With a tone that's equally anxious and lovesick, the British singer confronts domestic bliss and finds her stride. Folk/Country Paleo Sol Barry Walker Jr. A geologist by day and pedal-steel virtuoso by night, Walker leads his bandmates in a stripped-down ambient country set attuned to the seismic forces that have shaped the Pacific Northwest. Experimental blue fifty-six Yapping Portal Under her latest alias, Angel Marcloid offers a beguiling collection of modular synth experiments that cycle between harsh textures and monochromatic expanses. Rap As of Now Lord Jah-Monte Ogbon Best New Album The Charlotte rapper\u2019s latest album is the height of his ability. The vignettes of heartbreak and hustling come with absurdist wit and an outstanding selection of beats. See More More Reviews Experimental Tranquilizer Oneohtrix Point Never Best New Album Drawing on a cache of commercial sample CDs, Daniel Lopatin assembles an impossibly dense and transportive electronic album that takes impermanence as its inspiration. Pop/R&B Addison Addison Rae The girlypop album of summer warrants comparison to Lana, Madonna, and most of all, Britney. Are we ready for Addison? Rock Snocaps Snocaps The Crutchfield twins\u2014accompanied by MJ Lenderman and Brad Cook\u2014reunite for a spirited new project that plays to their strengths and embraces all the miles they\u2019ve traveled. Pop/R&B LUX Rosal\u00eda Best New Album The Spanish singer\u2019s fourth record is a heartfelt offering of avant-garde classical pop that roars through genre, romance, and religion. Rap Stardust Danny Brown Working with a new vanguard of outsider electronic artists, the Detroit rapper lets his freak flag fry. The results are shaky but full of heart. Pop/R&B West End Girl Lily Allen With an album that doubles as an insider\u2019s account of a tabloid divorce, the singer finds a new evolution of her signature style: Lightness isn\u2019t a foil for irony, but a vehicle for hurt. Rap Lil Herb G Herbo Stepping into his teenage shoes for a loose concept album, the Chicago icon reflects on the original era of drill with the clarity of a scene veteran. Electronic Repulsor Shlohmo The L.A. beatmaker turns aggressive on his fourth album\u2014dialing up the distortion, flooding his beats with overdriven synths, and pushing anxious moods into the red.

New Reviews for February 6, 2026 Robbie Williams BRITPOP Columbia Pop/Rock AllMusic Rating: 4.0 stars The English icon's 13th studio set finds inspiration from across the British pop spectrum, making it all his own. - Neil Z.

The first decade-plus of her labyrinthine recording career was highlighted by the forthright Top 20 entries VII (2014), K.T.S.E. (2018), and The Album (2020). After releasing the latter, an intensely personal and wide-scoped recording, Taylor was active primarily with acting work, though she returned with the resolute breakup ballad \"Long Time\" heralding ...

AllMusic Staff Picks AllMusic Staff Pick \u2013 February 11, 2026 John Linnell State Songs October 26, 1999 Alternative Pop/Rock They Might Be Giants' John Linnell recorded an album's worth of songs about states, but never followed up with additional releases about the rest of the states -- not unlike Sufjan Stevens recording albums about Michigan and Illinois before abandoning that project as well. Of course, a lot of Linnell's state songs barely have anything to do with the actual states, instead suggesting that the states are basically the types of delusional characters and improbable situations that often populate his songs. In any case, the album stands up with TMBG's best work and shouldn't be missed by fans of the group. - Paul Simpson Editorial Picks for Vertical layout, Week 1 Interviews They Shot the Piano Player: An Interview with Filmmaker Fernando Trueba Radio on the TV The Super Bowl on Shuffle In Memoriam Sly Dunbar, 1952-2026 Our Properties AllMusic AllMovie SideReel Site Overview New Releases Discover Articles Recommendations About What is AllMusic?

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37451 Reviews Metamorphosis Banisher Overall, the album didn\u2019t pull any punches or stray too far from the path and the seemingly uncompromising vision of the band. If you are in the mood for continued shots of aggression and deep beatings, this is for you. Indestructible Metalodon You know that feeling when you see an album cover, and you just sit there knowing that the music inside is going to be bad or at least entertaining? Sky Eater King Cruel \u201cSky Eater\u201d is everything you\u2019d want from a sophomore album. For Stoner and Doom fans it\u2019s definitely worth checking out. Miserere Crossover So long as symphonic pirate isn\u2019t your bag, this album is sure to please. DeathAssault DeathAssault What I do know is that when DEATHASSAULT tones it down a bit, even becomes a bit of emotional in their approach, \"DeathAssault\" sounds a lot more intense and sincere. When the singer then puts on his clean vocals, you feel that you have entered a whole other world. Sceaduhelm Crippled Black Phoenix Twelve songs overstayed its welcome just a bit, but some of the \u201cfiller\u201d songs helped to tell the story well. The album was dark at its core, but also melodic, and catchy. The dual vocalists helped to keep the album interesting, and it was plenty heavy. Overall, an excellent release. Nocturnal Visions Invictus I know of a few embodiments of a band with the name of INVICTUS, I had never heard of the Japanese version before. That has now been rectified and I can only say that I\u2019m glad to finally have listened to and experienced these Far East Death Metallers. One Scratch One Grub . If you\u2019re not strapped to your chair when seated and using speakers, or haven\u2019t fastened your headphones to you when listening that way, I advise you to get that done immediately. I can\u2019t tell you anything else than that SCRATCH ONE GRUB will blow you and/or your brains away if you\u2019re not careful. Hulders Ritual Slagmaur This was a delightfully commanding album that just didn\u2019t settle for taking prisoners. Indeed, the sound was rich, full, frightening, and even combative at times. Sha\u00e2tauno\u00e2r Hyver Leon Guiselin has ten other projects, so he's got a lot on his pentagram-shaped plate... Blood & Honey Summer Of Hate Summer Of Hate from Porto Portugal are an experimental shoegaze band that explores the boundaries [\u2026] Imagined Deformation BURIED \"Imagined Deformation\"\u00a0is a technically proficient, brutal death metal album, but most of its instrumentation is simply not to my taste. Upheaval of Necromancy Funeral Vomit Funeral Vomit offers straight-up death metal with no gimmicks, so they really need to bring it to stand out in the sea of death metal. Cult of the Sun Black Sea of Trees This was an excellent album, and as I mentioned above, it\u2019s the level of restraint that the band shows that it its shining feature. Ambiance, atmosphere, mystery, and darkness appear in bounds, and they always have the element of surprise. Malignant Cognition Architectural Genocide \u201cMalignant Cognition\u201d is recognised as a full-length album but I need you as a listener of this kind of music, but most of all buyer of physical or digital formats that the length of the whole experience is only 23:43 minutes. That is quite short. Echoes From The Past (Reissue) Deteriorot . If you are a real Death Metal fanatic you undoubtedly will know DETERIOROT and have your opinion at the ready. If, like me, this is a first encounter, I suspect that \u201cEchoes From The Past (Reissue)\u201d will rev up your interest in the history of the band. Entanglement Sun Of the Suns What I can say that if SUN OF THE SUNS ever come my way, I will be very much inclined to go and see their show. I would like to know whether they are able to emulate live what they have achieved in the studio and put on \u201cEntanglement\u201d. A Sea of Floating Mirrors Soundscapism Inc. This was a nice collection of songs that for me are just here to make you feel better. Melodies are smooth, simple, and easy to grasp, and there are hints of nostalgia here as well. Isn\u2019t that warm feeling you get when listening the point of music in the first place? Latest Interviews All 2132 Interviews Markus Lachendro Xfactor1 I took some time recently and sat down with Markus Lachendro, guitarist for the band [\u2026] Micha\u0142 Chro\u015bcielewski, Pawe\u0142 Smarkusz, Monika Chro\u015bcielewska CZART CZART is an experimental metal band hailing from Poland. The concept behind their debut album, \u201cCzarty Polskie,\u201d has been controversial not only for the AI debate but for the many references to Polish demonology. On All Hallows Eve, Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with members of CZART to discuss everything from AI to the reasons why metal resonates so much in Poland to whether we are living in the best of times or the worst. Most importantly, they discuss the beloved CZART goat. Sam Graff Agenbite Misery AGENBITE MISERY hails from New Hampshire. In February 2026, the band will be releasing their debut album, \"Remorse of Conscience.\" The album is an experimental metal interpretation of \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce. This month Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, was able to catch up with Sam Graff (guitars, vocals, synth) to discuss the some deeper details about the band, their aspirations, and their upcoming album as well as the curious link between literature and metal. Stefano Fiorelli Warcoe WARCOE hails from Pesaro, Italy. Formed in 2021, following the year of our plague, the Doom trio has been blazing a trail through the Italian Doom scene with one monumental album after the other. On September 26, 2025 they released their third full-length album, \u201cUpon Tall Thrones,\u201d which not only weighed in at 8/10 on the Metal Temple scales but hit #1 on Doom Charts for September 2025. This month Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, was able to catch up with Stefano Fiorelli (guitars, vocals) to discuss the origin story of WARCOE, details of their latest album, and even speculate on the impacts of AI and streaming platforms. Jacob Curwen All Hell All Hell has been described as a Blackened Thrash band, but they are much more. On October 10, 2025, the trio for Ashville, North Carolina release their fifth full-length album, \"Sunsetter,\" via Terminus Hate City. Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with Jacob Curwen (vocals, guitars) to discuss topics ranging from the band's origins to the details of \"Sunsetter\" to AI in metal.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Petrale \u2013 Goat at Sunset Review By Alekhines Gun on February 10, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 31 comments \u201cHailing from Croatia, one-man black metal project Petrale have arrived with some creepily straightforward artwork and an equally straightforward album title; will this be relegated to your ever-flowing streams, or have you reaching for your wallets?\u201d Goat on a black lake at sunrise. Bloodred \u2013 Colours of Pain Review By Mark Z. on February 10, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Blackened Death Metal , Death Metal , 22 comments \u201cSeeing an album described as \u201cblackened death metal\u201d almost always gets my juices flowing. The problem with that tag, however, is that it can mean anything from weird avant-garde blackened dissodeath (yuck) to Christcrushing necronuclear Blasphemy-worshipping goat metal (fukk yeah!!). But Bloodred are neither of those things. This German band is technically a duo but is really more like the solo project of vocalist, guitarist, and bassist Ron Merz, who\u2019s been enlisting the talents of drummer Joris Nijenhuis (ex- Atrocity , ex- Leaves\u2019 Eyes ) since the band\u2019s first releases back in the mid-2010s. I admittedly hadn\u2019t heard of these guys when I saw their name crop up in our promo bin, but I decided to give their back catalog a whirl when I saw Amon Amarth was tagged as a similar artist on Encyclopedia Metallum. MOAR blood for the Blood Gods? The Hirsch Effekt \u2013 Der Brauch Review By Twelve on February 9, 2026 in Reviews , Progressive Metal , 31 comments \u201cMotivation can be a tricky thing. Take me, for instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u2019s my first review of 2026, and I\u2019m already starting it later in the month than I meant to. For me, motivation has been a bit lacking. Now look at the subject of my first review, Der Brauch (\u201cThe Need\u201d) from German progressive metal act The Hirsch Effekt . This is their seventh full-length release in sixteen years of existence, a commendable testament to motivation, at the very least. And while putting pen to paper (figuratively) can be a hard thing to do, I love writing about a motivated group.\u201d Pause and effekt. Ashbringer \u2013 Subglacial Review By Lavender Larcenist on February 9, 2026 in Reviews , Atmospheric Black Metal , 12 comments \u201cWe here at AMG are impossible to please. Minnesota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmo-black four-piece Ashbringer have learned this the hard way. While we lavished praise across their discography, those who giveth can also taketh away. Ashbringer \u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous outing, We Came Here to Grieve , originally received glowing remarks. Unfortunately for them, resident shark and Ashbringer connoisseur, Carcharodon , decided, upon further reflection, that the clean singing on their previous outing brought the album to a screeching halt after time and distance brought clarity. So, as if in response, Ashbringer has returned with Subglacial , and there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an ounce of clean singing to be found on the album, as it provides an incredibly stripped-back sound in comparison to their previous outings.\u201d Ashes up! Old Sorcery \u2013 The Outsider Review By Spicie Forrest on February 9, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Dungeon Synth , 45 comments \u201cSwords and sorcery have served as metal muses since the genre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earliest days and for the most seminal acts. Indeed, many a writer here at AMG Studios has indulged in a game or three hundred of Dungeons & Dragons , and I imagine the same can be said of our esteemed commentariat. So, on the rare occasion that dungeon synth, the correct soundtrack for all D&D games, falls into the promo sump, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picked up fairly quickly. Old Sorcery \u00e2\u0080\u0099s newest full-length, The Outsider , didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even make it that far before Mystikus Hugebeard and I had a Canadian standoff about coverage and settled on this appropriately lengthy double review.\u201d Crawl and brawls. Lone Wanderer \u2013 Exequiae Review By ClarkKent on February 8, 2026 in Reviews , Funeral Doom , 27 comments \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that funeral doom is all about death, but in case you weren\u2019t aware, Lone Wanderer hits you over the head with the fact (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a fatal whack). The title of their latest record, Exequaie , is Latin for \u201cfuneral rites.\u201d The album cover, from Ernst Ferdinand Oehme\u2019s 1828 painting Procession in the Fog , depicts a ghostly funeral procession, and most song titles use death as a theme in some shape or form.\u201d Rites and wrongs of death. Profane Elegy \u2013 Herezjarcha Review By Thus Spoke on February 7, 2026 in Reviews , Atmospheric Black Metal , Black Metal , Blackened Death Metal , Melodic Black Metal , Post-Metal , 24 comments \u201c Herezjarcha\u00e2\u0080\u0094Arch-Heretic \u00e2\u0080\u0094is the sophomore of Pennsylvania-based Profane Elegy , who are determined to escape genre boundaries. Following the trajectory set by 2023\u2019s When All is Nothing , it sees the co-existence if not coalescence of black and death metal, but also an atmospheric, ambient kind of doom, and only doubles down on each aspect. It\u2019s not the first time a metal artist has claimed to eschew categorization, and many, if not most, modern artists in extreme subgenres borrow from less-extreme ones, and incorporate generous reverb. Profane Elegy \u2019s claims, therefore, don\u2019t excite special interest whether you\u2019ve heard the debut or not; listeners dis/like their sound on its own terms.\u201d Knowing profanity when you hear it. Bitterness \u2013 Hallowed Be the Game Review By Tyme on February 6, 2026 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 14 comments \u201cThrash metal trio Bitterness has been riffing around Germany\u2019s underground metal scene since 2002. And despite a twenty-plus-year career spent in a state of sustained anonymity, these thrashers three are ready to throw down their eighth full-length odyssey, Hallowed Be the Game . Marching under the thrash banner in a country that birthed not only the Big Teutonic 4, but some very endearing second-tier bands,  takes guts and persistence. Luckily, Bitterness has a little bit of both.\u201d In the game of German thrash, be bitter or be dead. Moon Mother \u2013 Meadowlands Review By Grymm on February 6, 2026 in Reviews , Not Metal , 26 comments \u201cI grew up with a slew of friends who dabbled in the visual arts throughout the years. One in particular blew me away by stating that the greatest artists aren\u2019t the masters of their trade in every aspect, but rather they know what they don\u2019t have, or rather don\u2019t need, to make a sizable impact. You don\u2019t need to own the most expensive paint set, a wide array of colors at your disposal, or to fill up the canvas with stuff. You have to just create your vision with what you have, and let the negative space do the work for you. Swedish duo Moon Mother knows this. On their second full-length, Meadowlands , they paint a lush, aural landscape teeming with anguish, grief, and trauma, while also crafting a sense of wonder, peace, and a smidge of hope.\u201d Marsh but fair. Tailgunner \u2013 Midnight Blitz Review By Steel Druhm on February 6, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , 65 comments \u201cAfter staggering off four crazy days at sea for the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise, my ears and brain are fried unto merciless death. Luckily, I anticipated this contingency and left myself a fairly easy bounce-back to reality with the sophomore album from England\u2019s classic metal rockers, Tailgunner .\u201d Shooting for and at the sky.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Destroyer :: Destroyer's Rubies Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close The Ibrahim Khalil Shihab Quintet :: Spring Recorded in the late 1960s by Cape Town pianist Ibrahim Khalil Shihab and his group, Spring calls to mind Atlantic-era Coltrane at its breeziest, with saxophonist Winston \u2018Mankunku\u2019 Ngozi fluttering above the steady, sunny backing. Though it has to be said that this collection of musicians could get heavy if need be; check out the masterfully moody vibe they bring to \u201cBirds,\u201d a ten-minute homage to Trane\u2019s \u201cSpiritual.\u201d Read More Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal The Beach Boys :: We Gotta Groove \u2013 The Brother Studio Years Posted on February 10, 2026 February 10, 2026 There is something undeniably miraculous about We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years . Here, after nearly half a century, is not just a presentation of some of the strongest, strangest music Brian Wilson would ever record, but a celebration of it. In the late 1970s, many of these songs were dismissed out of hand as the work of a diminished artist, a man irrevocably changed by years of milkshakes and mental anguish. This reading was not entirely incorrect: the Brian of 1977 was indeed a different person. But as an artist, he was in full flower\u2014more truly himself than he ever had been, and perhaps ever would be. Tony Joe White :: The Real Thang (Deluxe Edition) Posted on February 10, 2026 February 9, 2026 \u201cShe had disco sucks on the front of her t-shirt, a longneck bud in her hand\u2026\u201d  So sings Tony Joe White on \u201cRedneck Women,\u201d courtesy of his eighth long-player, 1980\u2019s The Real Thang . Core purveyor of the swamp rock amalgam alongside Bobby Charles, Lonnie Mack, Dale Hawkins, and Link Wray, White dropped this eight track album on Casablanca Records at the dawn of a new decade. Disco may have been in the ether, but this is swamp music mutating in real time. The Sha La Das :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on February 9, 2026 February 9, 2026 Sometimes a photograph can transport you back in time. On the cover of Your Picture , the second album from Staten Island soul combo The Sha La Das, appears a picture of the family matriarch, Linda. It was the same case with 2018\u2019s Love in the Wind . The photos were taken by the 79-year-old Bill Schalda, who fronts The Sha La Das with his sons, Paul, Will and Carmine. Though aged by time, these images present a different world, but one that Schalda says feels as real and immediate to him as the present. Honey Slides VI :: Shakey Covers Posted on February 9, 2026 February 6, 2026 Slip into the latest edition of our annual mix of rarities and oddities from the far-out reaches of the Shakeyverse. This year, we\u2019ve taken the opportunity to, er, shake things up with an hour\u2019s worth of weird/wonderful Neil covers stretching from the early 1970s to the present day. A\u00a0fun listen with plenty of highlights: Paris 1942 (with Moe Tucker on drums!) brutalizing \u201cRevolution Blues,\u201d Human Instinct\u2019s Muswell Hillbillies-esque \u201cEverybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\u201d Winged Wheel\u2019s instrumental flight through \u201cDanger Bird,\u201d Joan Shelley\u2019s gorgeous \u201cLittle Wing\u201d \u2026 and on and on! The Lagniappe Sessions :: The Nude Party Posted on February 9, 2026 February 10, 2026 The Nude Party return this month with the release of their latest\u2014and fourth\u2014LP, Look Who\u2019s Back . Produced by Michael Rault in the desert at his studio in Joshua Tree, the seven-piece outfit boots up, gets loose, and locks in over the course of the record\u2019s nine tracks. Keeping with the vibe, this installment of the Lagniappe Sessions catches up with the band as they pay tribute to 3\u2011Track Shack era, North Carolina godhead Link Wray, the mutable, perennial gem that is Chuck Willis\u2019s \u201cC.C. Rider,\u201d and the road-worn groove of \u201cSix Days on the Road.\u201d Cat Power :: What Would the Community Think at 30 Posted on February 6, 2026 February 6, 2026 By 1996, Chan Marshall had already recorded two lo-fi albums\u2014 Dear Sir and Myra Lee \u2014with Steve Shelley and Tim Foljan and moved from her native south to New York City. She had just turned 24 when she holed up at Easley Studios in Memphis to record album number three with the same team, her first time recording in a professional space. And while 1998\u2019s Mood Pix would serve as her breakout, this Matador debut captures the wild, raw, unfiltered power of Marshall\u2019s art, an unpredictable electricity that runs through the songs, buzzing and fizzing and threatening explosion at any time. Wilder Maker :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on February 6, 2026 February 6, 2026 Songwriter Gabriel Birnbaum\u2019s latest with Wilder Maker, 2025\u2019s The Streets Like Beds Still Warm , leans into sophisto-pop shaded indie pop noir, careening from rootsy swagger into bursts of digital space jazz and ambient funk. Birnbaum narrates like a streetwise-type who\u2019s been up way too long, finding warped and engaging hooks around every corner. He joins us to discuss. Videodrome :: Safe (1995) Posted on February 5, 2026 February 5, 2026 Safe has been called a psychological drama, a social satire, an allegory of the 1980s AIDS crisis, and a meditation on American culture in a post-industrial landscape. More than thirty years after its release, the film\u2019s peculiar themes remain open to interpretation, continuing to invite discussion and debate. Silvia Tarozzi :: Lucciole Posted on February 5, 2026 February 4, 2026 Lucciole , the latest album from Italian violinist, composer, vocalist, and improviser Silvia Tarozzi, unfolds like a strange existential drama. A richly layered work in every sense\u2014sonically, compositionally, thematically\u2014it seemingly traces the arc of a life in surrealist form while blending chamber folk, classical, and avant-garde sounds. Tarozzi immerses her voice in an environment of strings, horns, guitars, keys, theremin, zither, and sound manipulation, creating something that feels breathtaking alive \u2014 the music is radiant, luminous like its namesake. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on February 4, 2026 February 3, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Doopees :: Doopee Time Posted on February 4, 2026 February 4, 2026 An oddity on just about every front, 1995\u2019s Doopee Time is a fictional universe crafted by Japanese composer and steelpan drum maestro Yann Tomita. From the depths of Tomita\u2019s Audio Science Laboratory, the narrative-based concept album (featuring vocals and spoken vignettes by Buffalo Daughter\u2019s Yumiko Ohno) straddles a retro-futuristic line of sparkling art pop originals and innovative, genre-bending covers from the likes of The Ronettes to Pet Sounds closer \u201cCaroline, No\u201d. Touching on that Spector production, musique concr\u00e8te, cosmic jazz and a healthy dose of John Cage composition, Yann Tomita\u2019s conceptual vision of the fictitious Doopees is one not to be missed (even stretched out over seventy three minutes). Bandcamping :: Winter 2026 Posted on February 4, 2026 February 3, 2026 With the latest Bandcamp Friday hitting on Feb. 6, the time is right to melt the ice of winter 2026 with some fresh and far out sounds. Discover some recent/recommended tunes below. Shintaro Noguchi & The Roadhouse Band. Nailah Hunter & Alia. Zander Raymond. Hans Chew, Old Saw. Jessica Williams. Jake Xerxes Fussell & James Elkington. The Far Sound. Malombo. Joe Harvey-Whyte & Paul Cousins. Muriel Grossmann :: Plays the Music of McCoy Tyner and the Grateful Dead Posted on February 3, 2026 February 3, 2026 On a four-track double album, Austrian saxophonist Muriel Grossmann pays tribute to the music of two American visionaries: McCoy Tyner and Bob Weir. Though the music of the jazz pianist and Grateful Dead guitarist would not seem to have much in common, Grossmann\u2019s festive, idiosyncratic renditions suggest some intriguing links. With an ear for robust melody and an open-ended approach, Grossmann has created a moving tribute that suggests the only true way to carry on is to transform.

This is a review for a 2025 release A hair under two years is pretty quick turnaround time in the world of heavy metal. That doesn\u2019t translate much to a layman\u2019s way of thinking of course, as the old adage still holds true that creativity does not exist in a vacuum nor could you every try to put any time scale on inspiration. Some groups are prolific, others move at a snail\u2019s pace \u2013 it\u2019s a case of what works for some, may not work for others. That said, it\u2019s hard not to get a little spooked when turnaround time feels too quick between albums. Any number of events could take place in the background to cause it: new contracts may require new albums in a year, sometimes material gets backburnered or banked for future releases, but the year over year turn has just as often resulted in releases coming out as straight-shooting and \u201cexpected\u201d as an album could be. Quick releases are likely the home of more solid-sevens out there than anything else. But what then do you do when a band whose very existence is consistency, as if they themselves are the universal continuity upon which the world is built? Anything lesser would result in galactic cataclysm and anything more would equal a galactic sublimation. What if a band just exists on that line of \u201cgood-to-great\u201d or \u201cinarguably-solid-as-a-rock\u201d? What then does a quick-feeling turnaround time do to them? Even though the year may have ended, we still have to touch base with a few releases and one we weren\u2019t about to let escape from our sight was the mid-December unleashing of Blood Red Throne\u2019s latest album Siltskin .

Their music could be summed up as a dark and melodic brand of black metal infused with death and doom influences, but it is unusual in several respects. First and foremost, the music prominently features cello performances which (as Void Wanderer accurately portrays) are \u201csometimes melodic, sometimes abrasive, always engaging a dialogue with the guitars and carving out soundscapes between chaos and melancholy\u201d. But the music also includes a distinctive songwriting approach, which you\u2019ll discover for yourselves through our premiere today of the EP\u2019s first single, \u201c Stronghold \u201c.

One of the bands we spotlighted then was Organ from Belluno, Italy, and their extensive EP Eterno . We summed up the music as \u201cmassive, mountainous, megalithic music, and equally immense in the scale of its bleakness\u201d \u2014 \u201cboth crushing and celestial, mortifying but mesmerizing, apocalyptically desolate yet also delirious, reaching frenzies of intensity that seem to straddle the line between shattering grief and the rapture of being burned by holy fire.\u201d Eterno was indeed a stunning release, and left us looking forward to what the future would bring for Organ . It has been a very long wait, but at last Organ are returning, with a new album named IMMOBILISM that will be released on April 8th through Invisible Order Records . In addition to helping announce this eagerly anticipated event, today we\u2019re premiering one of the new album\u2019s five nightmarish tracks \u2014 \u201c DOGMA \u201c.

On February 6th they released four massive compilations of music with the pledge that all proceeds will be contributed to the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund . Each compilation has its own title and artwork, and they organize tracks contributed by bands into these four genre categories: Death Metal & Grindcore (33) Black Metal & Noise (35) Heavy & Atmospheric (35) Punk, Hardcore, Thrash & Madness (34) Altogether, the compilations include music from 137 bands , and many of them will be familiar to our visitors. The number of songs included on each comp is in parentheses above. Each compilation is very modestly priced \u2014 \u00a33.50 per comp \u2014 but purchasers can pay more if they wish, and of course the charitable purpose of this endeavor provides a good reason to do so.

Well, yes , obviously\u2026 and if you said \u201cno\u201d then you\u2019re probably just not doing it right\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t make these discoveries any less special or enjoyable. Case in point, the self-titled debut album from California Sludge/Doom quintet Ominess didn\u2019t take long to grab my attention \u2013 I think it was less than a minute into opener \u201cCathedral\u201d \u2013 and not much longer than that (probably around the time the first absolutely massive chord came crashing out of the speaker) for it to become clear that this was an album that more people needed to know about.

Now Svafnir has re-directed the music of Gladium Regis in a way intended to re-capture \u201cthe unpolished grandeur of early 1990s symphonic and epic black metal\u201d, and the results are manifested in a new album named Quest . Although Gladium Regis is Svafnir\u2019s solo project, he is accompanied on Quest by some talented guests: Davide Straccione ( Shores of Null ) provided guest vocals on three songs; Lupus Nemesis ( Atavicus ) joined Svafnir on additional instrumentation, choral arrangements, and final mixing at Genxia Studios; and Tamoth ( Obscura Nox Hibernis ) contributed acoustic guitar passages for the album\u2019s intro and intermezzo. What we have for you today is the premiere of the second single from Quest , a song named \u201c Durindana \u201c. But before we get to it, we want to share some of the words of introduction provided by the Dusktone label, which will release the album on February 27th : Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 8:58 am Tagged with: Gladium Regis AN NCS VIDEO PREMIERE:  AZIMUT AND OCTOPUS KRAFT \u2014 \u201cAGNI PARTHENE APOLEIA\u201d Premieres No Responses \u00bb Feb 09 2026 (written by Islander) In September 2023 the Ukrainian band Azimut independently released their debut album Stuma , which interwove a wide range of influences, including sludge, post-metal, and black metal. Now the boutique Ukrainian label Robustfellow Prods. is releasing Stuma on a limited edition of cassette tapes, with a special bonus track. The bonus track is a musical collaboration between Azimut and the Ukrainian project known as Octopus Kraft (now the solo endeavor of Yurii Dubrovskyi ). It\u2019s two-part title is \u201c Agni Parthene / Apoleia \u201c, and we\u2019re premiering a lyric video for it below. The piece is described as follows: Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 7:42 am Tagged with: Azimut , Octopus Kraft SHADES OF BLACK:  PILORI, SAILLE, DOODSWENS, FOGHAZER, PETRICHOR, 3 T Album Reviews , SHADES OF BLACK , SHORT BUT SWEET No Responses \u00bb Feb 08 2026 (written by Islander) I was out with my spouse and two other couples last night. Didn\u2019t get to bed until after midnight, didn\u2019t wake up until the morning hours were well underway, didn\u2019t feel very human at that point or at any other points leading up to the present. Fortunately, I had already made my choices for this column yesterday. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t think I would be in the best position this morning to explain why I like them so much. But in listening to the songs again, they completely blew away the mental cobwebs.

But it hasn\u2019t been long, only 14 days since ICE agents shot Pretti to death, even though it seems much longer than that. Undoubtedly other songwriters have already started releasing their own protests across many genres of music, though I wouldn\u2019t know (you\u2019re looking at the wrong dude if you want insight into the breadth of modern musical culture). Where I do tend to notice things are in the genres of extreme metal, and I guess a few \u201cmetal adjacent\u201d realms. Over the last week I noticed a handful of songs from those realms that were either protest songs or tracks designed to raise money in support of the resistance in Minneapolis to the sweeping seizure of immigrants (and racially profiled U.S. citizens). In the first section of this Saturday roundup I\u2019ve collected those songs, and one other that seemed appropriate. Fortunately, the music\u2019s good, in addition to the artists\u2019 hearts being in the right place. (If you know of more, please leave a Comment.) To round things out, I added three other very good songs that surfaced last week. I could have added 20 more, because it was a big week for new metal, what with yesterday being a Bandcamp Friday. But we do what we can.

Less than a year after the release of their full-length Under the Eternal Shadow (premiered and reviewed here at NCS ), London\u2019s Final Dose is back with a new EP, Endless Woe . Under the Eternal Shadow made it on my year-end list for 2025, so this latest release deserves some attention. Most press refers to Final Dose as hardcore-influenced black metal. While that\u2019s not necessarily wrong, it definitely minimizes what the group actually does. Certainly, they deliver the visceral assault such a descriptor implies. Opener \u201cGolden Chalice\u201d blends d-beats and punk moments with savage black metal, but Final Dose manages to maintain the atmosphere of black metal as well. The opening guitar figure evokes all the frost-bitten phantoms one can hope for, and then they segue into icy blasts. But just under two minutes in, a riff enters that splits the difference between Darkthrone and Minor Threat . It all works, whether one is meditating by candlelight or dancing in a pit; these guys have the magick.
