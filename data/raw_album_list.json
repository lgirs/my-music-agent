This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- are counting on him. [Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience. After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture, a city hidden beneath the sea. Constructed as an idealistic society for a hand picked group of scientists, artists and industrialists, the idealism is no more. Now the city is littered with corpses, wildly powerful guardians roam the corridors as little girls loot the dead, and genetically mutated citizens ambush you at every turn. Take control of your world by hacking mechanical devices, commandeering security turrets and crafting unique items critical to your very survival. Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels, explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them? [2K Games] 96 Metascore 18.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Barbarian \u2013 Reek of God Review By Mark Z. on January 23, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Heavy Metal , Speed Metal , Thrash Metal , 5 comments \u201cSometime in the 2010s, I started disliking music with too many flourishes and began seeking out stuff that was more stripped-down, unpolished, and primitive. At this time, Barbarian were the perfect find. Depending on the album, this Italian trio has referred to themselves as \u201cRegressive Metal,\u201d \u201cAbsolute Metal,\u201d or, in the case of their sixth album, Reek of God , \u201cRetrogarde Metal\u201d (typo and all). Led by vocalist and guitarist \u201cBorys Crossburn,\u201d their sound is essentially early Celtic Frost if they were fronted by a guitar-wielding grizzly bear who had a bizarre penchant for the occasional Running Wild -style melody.\u201d Smells like God in here! Temptress \u2013 hear Review By Killjoy on January 23, 2026 in Reviews , Doom Metal , Stoner Metal , 16 comments \u201cThe best things in life often happen organically. Temptress began in 2019 in Dallas, Texas, as three friends casually jamming together, and they had enough natural chemistry to decide to take their alluring stoner doom to the studio. Like someone who is well-versed in the art of seduction, they appear to be working their way through each of the five senses. Their debut full-length, see , was born in 2023, but now the time has come to close your eyes and hear what Temptress has conjured up for their sophomore record.\u201d hear in the now. Battering Ram \u2013 Time Masters Review By Baguette of Bodom on January 23, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Power Metal , Thrash Metal , 13 comments \u201cOccasionally, pet projects and casual fun bands can take a very long time to gestate into something more serious and tangible. Spain\u2019s Battering Ram has had quite a long journey to get to their self-released debut album Time Masters , starting from their formation in 2008 and their demos in the early 2010s. Over this time period, their ambitions have also grown. Evolved from just another thrash metal band, Time Masters is a sci-fi concept album looking to fuse epic heavy and power metal with technical thrash metal.\u201d Time is the fire in which we burn. Furi Helium \u2013 No Altar Stands Eternal Review By Dr. A.N. Grier on January 22, 2026 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 57 comments \u201cAfter list season comes to an end, there\u2019s an involuntary sigh of relief that all the work got done, and while a lot of the lists were shit, stylistically and format-wise, they looked good. But the first review of the year is a different kind of sigh. Not one of relief but one of \u2018here we go again.\u2019 So, with my knuckles cracked and promo downloaded, I dive into Spanish thrashers, Furi Helium , and their sophomore outing, No Altar Stands Eternal .\u201d Altared states. Casket \u2013 In the Long Run We Are All Dead By Spicie Forrest on January 22, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 12 comments \u201cFor over 30 years, Casket has been a reliable\u00e2\u0080\u0094if slow and not terribly well-known\u00e2\u0080\u0094source of classic death metal. Originally forming as a four-piece in Reutlingen, Germany in 1990, they released a slew of demos between 1992 and 1996 before releasing their debut, Under the Surface , in 1998. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released something (demo, EP, or LP) every five years or so since then, and aside from paring down to a trio in 2007, not much has changed since the early days.\u201d Getting laid in the coffin. AMG Goes Ranking \u2013 Megadeth By Grin Reaper on January 21, 2026 in AMG Rankings , Thrash Metal , 156 comments AMG ranks the vast discography of Megadeth in anticipation of their farewell magnum opus. Join with us! Beyond the Black \u2013 Break the Silence Review By ClarkKent on January 21, 2026 in Reviews , Hard Rock , Heavy Metal , Power Metal , Symphonic Metal , 31 comments \u201c Beyond the Black play the sort of female-led symphonic metal that seems to get a bit of traction in Europe. Since Jennifer Haben formed the band in 2014, they have recorded five LPs that climbed the charts in her home country of Germany as well as those of neighboring countries. Break the Silence , their sixth record, finds them at their peak. It\u2019s a concept album revolving around themes of communication and connection.\u201d Can\u2019t you hear me screaming? Deathraiser \u2013 Forged in Hatred Review By Holdeneye on January 20, 2026 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 60 comments \u201cWhen considering what Brazil is best known for, people often throw out things like the Amazon rainforest, round-ball football, coffee, beef, and that really tall statue of the Christmas Superstar, but you and I both know that Brazil is primarily known for thrash metal. Seeking to add to that legacy, Deathraiser is raising themselves from the dead by releasing sophomore album Forged in Hatred a mere 15 years after their debut.\u201d Hate can\u2019t be built in a day. Moon Wisdom \u2013 Let Water Flow Review By Creeping Ivy on January 20, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Punk , Shoegaze , 31 comments \u201cMetal Fatigue is not a moral failing: it is a physiological phenomenon, befalling even the most honorable of headbangers. Though traditional metal can tire in its own way, Metal Fatigue mostly lurks on the severe side of the genre. Too often, extreme metal exhausts by coupling sonic monotony with album lengths more appropriate for episodes of prestige television. Given my own struggles with Metal Fatigue, I was intrigued to see Let Water Flow \u00e2\u0080\u0094a 28-minute black metal record from Moon Wisdom \u00e2\u0080\u0094sitting in the sump.\u201d Waterborn or waterlogged?

Arson Burning Future EP There are few things in life that get my blood pumping as thoroughly as NYC raw punk, and ARSON is a pacemaker set to overdrive. On their latest release Burning Future , their six tracks of noise-drenched crasher crust harkens to ANTI-CIMEX greased up with ZYANOSE. If you missed ARSON\u2019s 2024 release M\u00e1s Noise, or if your life hasn\u2019t felt right since PERDITION broke up, then now would be a great time to check out ARSON. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label General Speech Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Beta Voids Scrape It Off 10\u2033 It would be easy to talk about the saxophone, but listen to BETA VOIDS hard-charge through brilliantly crafted, hardcore-tinged, multi-vocal blasts of punk, and you almost forget that there\u2019s this weird woodwind layer lurking in the shadows on every track\u2026so instead of talking about the saxophone, I think it\u2019s better to just acknowledge its existence and move on. The songs, though \u2014the songs are straight killers. Timeless, high-energy cuts that owe a debt to early California hardcore while firmly maintaining their own unique and expressive character. And \u201ccharacter\u201d is really the word I\u2019ve been looking for while I listen to Scrape It Off (again)\u2014that\u2019s the thing BETA VOIDS have, and it\u2019s the quality that you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re missing in your punk until you hear it. Apparently they do things different in coastal Oregon. Reviewer Robert Collins Label Hovercraft Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Brut MMXXIII \u2013 MMXXIV LP This is very unique and different\u2014a combination of post-punk and Oi! (which becomes even more apparent when you reach the JOY DIVISION and BLITZ covers later on in the slab). This is a collection of several singles and EPs that BRUT released between 2023 and 2024. The guitarist is playing at such high octaves that I thought they were running a mandolin through a chorus pedal at first. Maybe they are, there are no liner notes included. It gives the tracks this real dreamy quality that pairs well with the treble-heavy bass and dark, barking vocals. Extremely catchy and well-constructed tunes here. A very impressive output for a single calendar year. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Street Rats Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Chance Operation Chance Operation 12\u2033 reissue No New York might have signaled the beginning of the end of New York no wave in its labelling, defining, and constraining a scene that purposely took root as a negation of such things, but meanwhile, there was an entire parallel network of Japanese bands forming in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s who were directly inspired by the anarchic, brink-of-collapse art-spark that had made New York\u2019s downtown sound so thrilling. CHANCE OPERATION was one of the very best to do it, not unlike a James Chance-less CONTORTIONS if you wanted to get simplistic\u2014ultra-trebly (and frequently slide-manipulated) chicken-scratch guitar, loping mutant funk bass lines, minimalist, jazz-schooled drumming. This five-song 12\u201d (one of three CHANCE OPERATION records recently reissued as part of Spittle\u2019s Made in Japan side venture) was originally released in 1981, sounding for all intents and purposes like it came straight from the floor of the Mudd Club, from \u201cWinecolor Sick\u201d slinking and skronking beneath sparse, perfectly disinterested vocals from bassist Higo Hiroshi and guitarist Yoshiko Komiyama, to the fractured disco-not-disco danceability of \u201cImage Dance,\u201d to the cyclical bass rumble tussling with pinpoint guitar in \u201cDin.\u201d Do I even have to say that it rules? Seek out 1982\u2019s Spare Beauty EP and 1985\u2019s Place Kick LP while you\u2019re at it, it\u2019s easier to do so now than ever before! Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Spittle Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Der Moderne Man Unmodern LP reissue Originally released in 1982 as DER MODERNE MAN\u2019s second studio album, Tapete has reissued this along with the band\u2019s first LP, 80 Tage Auf See , as well as some previously unreleased singles, EPs, and demos (on the Jugend Forscht 2xLP). Based in Hanover, Germany, DER MODERNE MAN found themselves at the forefront of the punk and new wave scenes coming out of the area, freely mixing genres and styles. The opener \u201cAnakonda\u201d starts with a moody feel, featuring a slinky bass line and some spooky vocals, only to move on to dub influences on songs like \u201cNur Die,\u201d featuring some classic reggae synths, guitars, and saxophones. I also hear psych rock guitars on \u201cNicht Warten,\u201d followed by a danceable, poppy electronic beat on \u201cGurus und Geheimagenten.\u201d All to say, this album is full of texture, surprises, and is certainly worth your time. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Tapete Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Expunge / Panic Defense Tools to Kill Humans split cassette One man\u2019s anger is another man\u2019s weapon. EXPUNGE and PANIC DEFENSE share members and even jam on each others\u2019 songs. This collective decided to immortalize their love for the void with Tools to Kill Humans . It pounds on your eardrums with serrated riffs and punk ferocity coated with an oily layer of feedback. Each track is a wrecking ball of chaos that emulates the bleakness of a dystopian age. It\u2019s primitive, it\u2019s aggressive, it\u2019s messy, and it\u2019s grinding violence. For those who\u2019ve already given up on fixing the system. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Hey Fuck You Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Flores y Fuego Wabi-Sabi cassette Raw and emotional punk that embraces imperfection as a weapon. FLORES Y FUEGO balance melody and abrasion, letting cracked vocals and rough edges carry the emotional weight. The songs feel intimate but still aggressive, with a DIY urgency that comes through loud and clear. The cassette format only sharpens that immediacy. Punk crudo y emotivo que toma la imperfecci\u00f3n como arma. Flores y Fuego equilibran melod\u00eda y aspereza, dejando que las voces quebradas y los bordes filosos carguen el peso emocional. Las canciones son \u00edntimas pero agresivas, con una urgencia DIY muy marcada. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Decline Humano Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Fosgene Ancora Tumulti Ancora Tempesta cassette With the release of their second tape, Bassano del Grappa\u2019s FOSGENE re-emerges as a dense and direct force of nuanced D-beat power. Although you can hear the menace of Italian champions like WRETCHED and IMPACT in their twisting riffs and charging hardcore, it\u2019s black around the edges and tempered by crusty dystopian dirges, taking the sound to places the aforementioned bands only hinted at. With intelligent tackling of heavy political and social subjects in the lyrics, there\u2019s a stream of anarcho energy to the carefully composed tracks as well, furthering their alluring complexity. It\u2019s strong stuff, a dark stew that leaves you ready to explore these savage expanses further. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Sistema Mortal Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Gino and the Goons Gino and the Goons LP It\u2019s been long enough since I last thought about this band that the word \u201cgoon\u201d has taken on a cool new meaning. Just one more thing I gotta wrestle with as I give these dudes another go! Anyway, I\u2019ve always liked the idea of GINO AND THE GOONS\u2014a handful of Floridians approaching middle-age (probably full-blown at this point!), who seemingly didn\u2019t have a history playing music, saying \u201cfuck it\u201d and forming a budget rock band at a time when most punks wanted nothing to do with that sound. Real laudable shit! Unfortunately, that admiration did little in the way of helping me enjoy their music. I never hated it or anything, but their songs just never did it for me. So, I went into this release, their sixth(!) LP, with pretty low expectations. Now, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because my expectations were so low, because I\u2019ve mellowed a little in the ten-ish years since I last listened to them, or because they\u2019ve grown as songwriters\u2014probably some combination of all three\u2014but I kinda dug this. The nine tracks that make up the record mix RAMONES-y dum-dum punk, glam, and druggy garage punk (think fellow Sunshine Staters JACUZZI BOYS). Am I ready to erect a GOON cave for some prolonged GOON seshes? I am not. But this record was OK enough to get the job done. Reviewer Alex Howell Label Slovenly Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Megaphonies Right to Double Down CD Melodic and fuzzy power pop from Sacramento. Heavy, deep riffage that brings to mind DEATH FROM ABOVE 1979 and a slew of classic rock bands; kind of like a modern, punked-up version of FOGHAT. This is a pretty bluesy-sounding album, lyrically and musically, which is shockingly refreshing. Production sounds great and the band comes off huge for being just a trio. I won\u2019t lie, this was an unexpected hit for me. I wasn\u2019t sure what a band called MEGAPHONIES was going to sound like, and they completely blew me out of the water. You\u2019re gonna wanna spin this one a couple times. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Minot Walls / People Pleaser 7\u2033 Lo-fi, pop-tinged garage punk from Missoula, Montana. The A-side \u201cPeople Pleaser\u201d sounds like Toody Cole fronting the VELVET UNDERGROUND or BEAT HAPPENING; sparse instrumentation with chilling vocals and a cool organ line throughout it. The B-side \u201cWalls\u201d was not as interesting. The vocals annoyed me so badly that I couldn\u2019t finish the song, and I tried twice. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Phantom Pike Phantom Pike demo cassette Nothing warms my cold Midwestern heart more than hearing good new punk music from Illinois, and Central Illinois no less. PHANTOM PIKE is a fresh outfit based in Springfield who take UK82/Oi!, add black metal vocals and some dramatic instrumentals, and dress it all up in chainmail. They call it \u201cSkull Rock,\u201d and you know what? It does fucking rock. Check this one out. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Mister Face Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Schenectavoidz Void Beyond the Pines LP Hardcore punk bong attack! SCHENECTAVOIDZ have crashed back into the world with a release that feels like the spiritual (and extremely stoned) offspring of their old band DEVOID OF FAITH, but weirder and way more THC-soaked. Void Beyond the Pines sounds like what happens when punks take the same rage they had in the \u201990s, lace it with paranoia, and hotbox it until their minds start to melt away. The dual-vocal assault hits you like a fistfight in a dirty basement stairwell, the guitars grind and wobble like someone recorded them inside a smoke-clouded garage, and the drums keep everything lurching forward, even when the whole thing feels like it might wander off to stare at tree branches for a minute. It\u2019s still punk as hell, but with a baked edge that gives the whole release a disoriented charm. A perfect soundtrack for getting high and getting pissed-off at the same time. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Shock to the System Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Stiff Nights Like a Rat / Summertime 7\u2033 Call \u2018em \u201cZZ BOTTOM\u201d\u2014STIFF NIGHTS are some strangely-inspired dudes from Tennessee playing punky, glam-infused, stripped-down Southern rock jams. Rather than go for speed, they let the songs linger, with both sides of the 45 allowing enough time to slam one beer down and crack another. By the time the purple/pink vinyl stops spinning, you\u2019ve got a decent buzz going and you\u2019re headed to the saloon for an evening of debauchery. You might even wake up the next morning \u201ccoyote\u201d style, as the old legend goes: head throbbing, spooning with a mystery monster, and faced with the unfortunate dilemma of having to chew your own arm off to escape undetected. Reviewer Jason Harding Label WereOpossum Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Unidad Ideologica Choque Asim\u00e9trico LP A crushing statement of militant hardcore punk rooted in confrontation and discipline. UNIDAD IDEOL\u00d3GICA delivers rigid, marching riffs and commanding vocals that sound built for the street and the barricade. Lyrically and sonically uncompromising, the record channels organized anger rather than chaos, drawing power from clarity and ideological focus. Choque Asim\u00e9trico feels like a call to resist, positioning hardcore punk as a tool of conflict rather than escape. One of the most forceful and politically charged releases of the moment. Una declaraci\u00f3n aplastante de hardcore punk militante, basada en la confrontaci\u00f3n y la disciplina. UNIDAD IDEOL\u00d3GICA presentan riffs r\u00edgidos y marciales junto a voces autoritarias, pensadas para la calle y la barricada. Sin concesiones en lo l\u00edrico ni en lo sonoro, el disco canaliza bronca organizada en lugar de caos, apoy\u00e1ndose en la claridad y el enfoque ideol\u00f3gico. Choque Asim\u00e9trico funciona como un llamado a resistir. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label La Vida Es Un Mus Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 AOA / Oi Polloi Unlimited Genocide split LP reissue Fuck me, although I feel like we\u2019re barely in autumn, it is actually past Christmastime already, and for the consumerist nightmare it always entails, Santa might have been in a punk rock phase last year, because I got assigned a genuine UK anarcho-punk classic for review: the Unlimited Genocide split LP between AOA and OI POLLOI from Scotland. Originally released in 1986 on Children of the Revolution, it has remained a largely unsung classic and has finally gotten the proper reissue treatment thanks to Sealed Records, which we all should be thankful for. Although not the biggest name in the hardest-hitting anarcho-punk school of the \u201980s (being Scottish may sadly not have helped in a very London-centric scene), AOA recorded three crucial\u2014and hard-to-find, obviously\u2014records during their run, and this is the second one. Being a sucker for the genre, I have been a massive fan since I first heard them through a wise punk elder. AOA has often been described as furious, and the attribute is well-deserved. Fast-paced, angry, DISCHARGE-inspired political hardcore punk, just before the rise of UK crust and the metal invasion. I am heavily reminded of cult bands like ANTISECT or ANTI-SYSTEM, but I\u2019d argue that the Scots may have given more than a passing listen to the ICONOCLAST as well. On the other side, we have the much more famous and iconic anarcho band OI POLLOI, who everyone knows at least by name and is able to sing along to \u201cPunx Picnic.\u201d I guess you could say that, despite a certain status and popularity, we don\u2019t really explore the band\u2019s long discography critically, and their side of the split documents them at a time when they still partook in anthemic, if a bit cheesy, rough anarcho Oi! (like on the split with BETRAYED), but also embracing the faster and more abrasive anarcho-punk philosophy in terms of sound (like on the TOXIK EPHEX one)\u2014like any sane punk would have done, really. What\u2019s great with OI POLLOI is that you can instantly recognize Deek\u2019s very distinctive vocals, so you always know where you stand. The songs here are mostly fast, but the band also slows things down, remaining heavy and threatening. I forgot how great these songs were, very reminiscent of ICONS OF FILTH, CONFLICT, or even ANTISECT, and it\u2019s got my favourite of theirs, \u201cThe Only Release.\u201d A great record that tackled political issues that are sadly as relevant as ever today. Essential stuff. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Sealed Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Cemento Bad Dream Songs LP CEMENTO out of Los Angeles has been compiling a library of goth-inspired post-punk epics for the past few years, and many of those tracks appear on their fresh full-length entitled Bad Dream Songs . Produced in conjunction with Iron Lung Records, CEMENTO\u2019s sound is pushed to a monolithic depth on Bad Dream Songs , allowing the band to fully exhibit their artistry. If you were into Sacred Bones\u2019 release of the HUNT\u2019s The Hunt Begins in 2013, or if you\u2019re into things like the early works of the CULT and CHRISTIAN DEATH, then you should check out Bad Dream Songs . Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 DSM-5 / Varoitus \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland Jawbreaker split LP A crushing split LP pairing two distinct but equally bleak visions of modern hardcore. DSM-5 delivers suffocating, noise-laced hardcore punk that feels mentally claustrophobic, with repetitive riffs and desperate vocals mirroring psychological collapse. VAROITUS counters with cold Finnish D-beat, sharp and militant, channeling classic Scandinavian hardcore with a contemporary sense of urgency. A relentless record that leaves no room for comfort. Un split LP demoledor que une dos visiones distintas pero igualmente sombr\u00edas del hardcore actual. DSM-5 presenta un hardcore punk asfixiante y cargado de ruido, con riffs repetitivos y voces desesperadas que reflejan un colapso mental constante. VAROITUS responde con D-beat finland\u00e9s fr\u00edo y militante, afilado y urgente, heredero directo del hardcore escandinavo cl\u00e1sico. Un disco implacable, sin concesiones. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Phobia Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Emmett O.C. 9 From the Warped Mind LP First solo project from Emmett O\u2019Connor (ARCHIE AND THE BUNKERS, MK ULTRAS) out of Cleveland. Inside this warped mind, we find bedroom synth punk complete with drum machine, warbling lead lines, and earnest, droning vocals, like on \u201cPieces of My Life\u201d where O\u2019Connor croons \u201cLike a shining light from up above / She came down and she gave me her love.\u201d \u201cBurger King From My Dreams\u201d gets a little sillier, and brings to mind the Technics organ tone of WESLEY WILLIS, with shades of \u201cRock n Roll McDonalds\u201d to boot. On \u201cThe Air Conditioning is Making Me Sick\u201d he gets a little heavier, channeling some BABY TYLER or maybe ALIEN NOSEJOB with a mock seriousness. \u201cCurtain Call\u201d plays that wobbly organ again, with some doo wop in place of the drum machine, which maybe leads us to his \u201950s rocker/James Dean influence displayed on the album cover? Layer all these things together, and I find myself thrown for a complete loop. Yet here I am, enjoying 9 From the Warped Mind quite a darn bit. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Sweet Time Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Fin Dystopia cassette Six-song debut cassette from Middle Tennessee. At first I thought FIN sounded like an alt-rock-leaning indie band, but after further observation, I now believe they sound like an indie-leaning alt-rock band. Might sound like a nominal distinction, but I stand by it, with the difference-maker being production quality. This debut cassette is self-recorded by the band and has a bit of grit to it. The obvious cue to me came with the last song, \u201cTalk Too Much,\u201d a repetitive grunge number which truly sounded to me like it could have been a reworked NIRVANA song. Any way you cut it, FIN seems to dabble in a lot of \u201990s throwback genres, so if the \u201990s are your thing, snag yourself one of the 25 copies of this tape before you miss out. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Tennessee Cold Cuts Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Gape Reduced to Nothing EP Minimal and direct. Los Angeles-based GAPE opens with a blast of do-or-die hardcore energy. Eight tracks, just over ten minutes in total, and absolutely no filler. From the opening notes of \u201cWest Co.\u201d to the closing \u201cSeasons,\u201d the band delivers the kind of short, sharp, unforgiving intensity that hardcore was built for: fast tempos, fast riffs, and riot-inducing shouting. The record never lets up, exactly what you want from a 7\u2033 when you feel like you need to rip the world a new one. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Leti Y Los Utensilios Fuego EP Debut EP from LETI Y LOS UTENSILIOS from Madrid, Spain. Four songs of dark, brooding punk with driving bass that grounds a razorblade guitar, cymbal-crashing drums, and a female vocalist with plenty of bite. \u201cFuego\u201d and \u201cSubir Bajar\u201d on the A-side hit pretty hard and chug right along, while the B-side\u2019s \u201cHaloperidol\u201d and \u201cBotox\u201d fall into a bit more of a garage groove, with some guitar solos and riffing. Overall, this is a great debut, and I\u2019ll be excited to see where they go from here. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Delia Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Night Court Nervous Birds! LP Vancouver\u2019s NIGHT COURT is back with a remastered reissue of their first two releases, ( Nervous Birds! One and Nervous Birds! Too ) on one LP. NIGHT COURT plays lo-fi garage pop that leans more toward the dirt pop spectrum than garage punk. It\u2019s straightforward, sometimes jangly, and there\u2019s a pop element throughout. The lyrics are audible and intelligent, full of pop culture references, wasted nights, and sarcasm, and often delivered via dual vocalists. \u201cSurfin Iona\u201d is a standout for me, with drummer Emilor taking the lead and sounding like a bizarro version of Kate Pierson of the B-52\u2019S. There\u2019s a line from the song \u201cYr Ride\u201d that stuck with me after a few listens: \u201cDeath is a hard ride / Heaven\u2019s a joyride / Until you get caught with your pants down.\u201d If there\u2019s a heaven, I certainly want to arrive bare-assed! For someone with zero attention span, 26 songs is a lot to digest at once. I get why these were originally separate releases, but existing fans will love having these in all one place and on vinyl for the first time. It\u2019s a cool showcase of the band\u2019s early output, and fans of bands like MARKED MEN or even early SHINS will find something to love. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Debt Offensive / Drunk Dial / Shield / Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Pill Mill Trimming the Fat EP British Columbia\u2019s PILL MILL deliver the goods on their debut EP, a speedy hardcore punk attack bursting at the seams with the same frantic energy that the X-Claim! roster excelled at. Turbo-charged riffs, manically paced drum fills, and distorted, sneering vocals ensure every box is checked, putting this in league with Neon Taste labelmates CHAIN WHIP and SSIK (with whom the band shares members). Highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Neon Taste Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Screensaver Three Lens Approach LP SCREENSAVER out of Melbourne has been pumping out material for the past six years, and on their latest full-length Three Lens Approach , they invite us to a gothic synth punk dub party that has us dancing to the unexpected shifts between DEVO-ish rhythms to more melancholic \u201cDeath Disco\u201d inspirations. Multiple synthesizers fire off as hard-hitting bass lines and fierce guitar licks create an immersive atmosphere, while Krystal Maynard\u2019s vocals are charged and velvety. Occasionally I\u2019m reminded of things like the EPOXIES or CRASH COURSE IN SCIENCE, but SCREENSAVER is definitely carving out a sound that is uniquely their own. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Poison City Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Serial Pest Living in Fear cassette Pure knuckle-dragging Aussie hardcore, with zero mercy. Living In Fear rips with frantic drums, guitar tone straight out of a damp squat, and vocals that sound like someone screaming through a wall of cigarette smoke. Everything here is fast, mean, and gloriously ugly. SERIAL PEST doesn\u2019t bother with anything resembling restraint, just wild, swinging chaos and fist-in-the-air rage. Feels less like a recording and more like stumbling into the wrong backyard show and getting shoved straight into the pit. If you want thrashy hardcore that bites, spits, and leaves the room smelling worse than when it started, this is it. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Noise Merchant Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Shop Talk Museum of Sex / Gaslight 7\u2033 Solid two-song slab from this Brooklyn trio. Power pop with a little bit of a street punk edge, kind of like a beefier EXPLODING HEARTS/BUZZCOCKS concoction. Laden with earworm vocals and catchy guitar work, this pair of tracks goes by way too quickly. I want more, dammit! Really lovely work here. Add this to your winter playlist to combat your S.A.D. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label One Track Mind Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Sikphuxz Punk is Shit EP Formed in Victoria, BC in 1979, SIKPHUXZ was the first effort from Murray \u201cThe Cretin\u201d Acton, who would later go on to assemble the legendary DAYGLO ABORTIONS. Though there were no official releases from these early Canadian punks, they did record a handful of tracks that have been unearthed and remastered on this archival EP that comes with extensive liner notes and photos. The roots of Murray\u2019s trademark irreverence are on display here in songs like the title track and \u201cI\u2019m So Dumb,\u201d alongside more straightforward punk tunes like \u201cLet\u2019s Run Away\u201d and \u201cP.O.W.,\u201d offering an interesting glimpse of history. It\u2019s a cool little package, and the DAYGLO guys are still going strong today, with members having been arrested on drug charges as recently as fall of last year. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Supreme Echo Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Abism Barbie Terminator EP Right before the first time I heard ABISM\u2019s new 7\u201d, I\u2019d just finished jamming a live boot of the VELVET UNDERGROUND, and I was amazed by the freedom of the faded guitar pokes and messing around, demonstrating how bravely primitive and self-conscious they were (and which I guess is the essence of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, to be a confident dilettante). This feeling probably stuck with me when \u201cBarbie Terminator\u201d kicked in with its cacophonic guitar scraping and burst of pumping beats that meticulously, or by instinct, are set to a tempo that grabs attention and moves bodies. Then by the second song, the fuzzed guitars started playing notes that are weird, not too technically difficult but remarkable when paired with confidence and taste, because fuck it\u2014some of us do mess around with such ideas at odd hours of the day under odd circumstances and wonder whether it is okay to include them even in radikal punk songs. ABISM\u2019s new record is a straight \u201cfuck you\u201d to those thoughts, because this sounds great and it fits a hardcore song. Only four rudimental hardcore tracks reflecting the universal frame of many signature scenes\u2019 sound, with a wink to those roots that make the record sound simple and original, and which combined recall dozens of the best bands without referencing any of them. This balance is the challenge of sounding original nowadays after everybody has heard everything and still ever-wanting more of this raw power. Another highly confident \u201cfuck you\u201d is the riff of \u201cFly Away\u201d\u2026you have a four-song 7\u201d, and you dedicate a significant amount of time to summon LENNY KRAVITZ in the subconscious of your listeners? That is bold. But even the realization of this bizarre thing is not able to keep me from loving this record. I love the non-stop pogo beat and tight groove that delivers all the weird and cool guitar sounds, and the best raspy voice (familiar from the amazing GARRAPATA). Reviewer Viktor Vargyai Label Toxic State Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Atol Atol Atol Dron Dron Dron LP ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s 2023 LP Koniec Sosu Tysi\u0105ca Wysp completely threw me for a loop\u2014taut, twin-vocal Polish art-punk with a minor DOG FACED HERMANS fixation? I might as well be Pavlov\u2019s dog. Follow-up Dron Dron Dron is just as mind-warping, centering the band\u2019s anxious electronic textures and snap-tight rhythms like an alternate-timeline Hardcore -era DEVO that wound up on Ron Johnson Records alongside the EX and BIG FLAME. Opener \u201cNeon\u201d is a perfect example of the band\u2019s controlled chaos, locking straight into a staccato, mechanical groove with skittering guitar, a bass line bouncing everywhere like an errant rubber Superball, and doubled-up chants from vocalists \u0141ukasz and Agata, all of which could be panic-inducing (or just irritating) in lesser hands, but it\u2019s completely hypnotic here. Likewise, the densely knotted skronk of \u201cBlok\u201d might easily tip into prog-punk territory were it not for some wild, collapsing drum breakdowns, but when the frenetic call-and-response in \u201cP\u0142ytki Sen\u201d hits against some incessantly buzzing synth and treble-maxed guitar cutting in like the quickest of knife flicks, there\u2019s no question that ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s true objective is putting the damage back in \u201cart-damaged,\u201d and they\u2019re killing it. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Mangel / Red Wig Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Blood Cannery Olympic Blood cassette If you\u2019re in the mood for something challenging, BLOOD CANNERY\u2019s latest concept album about a man facing (possibly supernatural) beasts on the early American frontier might be exactly what you\u2019re searching for. \u201cOlympic Blood\u201d sounds like a LIGHTNING BOLT-versus-KYUSS showdown with super-fuzzed, whammy-heavy guitar shreds placed against hyperactive drums and muffled vocals. The lyrical tales of curses, attacking brutes, and violence sometimes evokes aesthetically coherent heavy punk experimentation, and sometimes skews toward \u201c Faaaar out, man!\u201d stoner excess, but it\u2019s always enjoyable. Check it out for a conceptual romp through blood, dirt, and heavy riffs. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Cheap Fix Re-Animator Blues / French Song 7\u2033 This is CHEAP FIX\u2019s debut 7\u201d. Garage punkers from your dad\u2019s days. They all play in a bunch of different bands (TRAINWRECK, ENDURO, DECEMBER BOYS) and join together on this 7\u201d for two songs sans bass guitar. This is workin\u2019 class, \u201cdone with the day job,\u201d fuzzy, bluesy shit from the constant maestros in class, Goodbye Boozy. Could be Mark Arm\u2019s cousin singing. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Goodbye Boozy Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Contrast Attitude Discharge Your Noise LP Although they have been around for more than 25 years, Discharge Your Noise is only CONTRAST ATTITUDE\u2019s second album. Needless to say, I preordered what promised to be an exercise in intensity and ferocity as soon as possible\u2014the limited version of course, out of excitement. It would be far-fetched to claim that these Mie punks have drastically changed their sound (a new drummer, Daigo from DECEIVING SOCIETY or RADIOACTIVE, did join them, though), but I have to confess that I was a little disappointed when I first played the vinyl. Of course, the high-level energy and relentless hardcore aggression, trademarks of the band\u2019s sound, are still there, but the guitar is not as distorted, if perhaps heavier, and I suppose on this LP, CONTRAST ATTITUDE cannot really be described as the crust monster they once were. As a result, probably because I was expecting that typical \u201cwall of noise\u201d bollocking like it was still 2009, I was, well, disenchanted for a bit. Listening to the LP again for this review, I realize that it is, in fact, a solid work that, once I accepted change, I was more than able to enjoy thoroughly and play air guitar to when no one is looking. The music is still as fast and punishing, the vocals as anguished and extreme, the unstoppable D-beat noize has not disappeared, but a lot of the arrangements (and generally the songwriting and the production) point to more traditional Japanese hardcore to my ears. The band even experiments with paces a little with the very punky \u201cFeeling of the Freedom\u201d and the heavier and slower \u201cDisclose Naked Myself.\u201d I feel Discharge Your Noise is in between both styles, and while it won\u2019t alienate the traditional CONTRAST ATTITUDE fans, it may actually appeal to other people who don\u2019t necessarily wear DISCLOSE pajamas (unlike me). A good record that I still wish was a little crustier. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Desolate / D-Takt & R\u00e5punk Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Dark Thoughts Highway to the End LP Six years after their last record, Philadelphia\u2019s DARK THOUGHTS have reemerged as dialed-in as ever on this brand new slab. The tunes are tight and concise, never overstaying their welcome and always getting the point across within their brief duration. Applying the poppy and speedy formula of classic SCREECHING WEASEL and RAMONES to maximum effect, the songs hit hard with relatability, realism, and hope. They\u2019re what I wished every band sounded like when I was sixteen. \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Be Lonesome\u201d is the perfect reassuring follow-up to the previous album\u2019s heartbreaking \u201cWith You,\u201d with which I positively tortured myself at the time of its release. Or is \u201cSweet Success\u201d the real happy ending? Either way, I\u2019m glad the story isn\u2019t over. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Drunken Sailor / Stupid Bag Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Flux Peace is a Lie LP Ten pogo-inducing corkers from Belgium\u2019s latest and greatest FLUX, a band that has done their homework and sounds as authentic as anything from the UK in 1982. Speed, anger, and just the right amount of snot make this a thoroughly enjoyable listen; by the halfway point of \u201cPunk Retaliation,\u201d you\u2019ll be pumping your fist and spilling your beer along to the proceedings. For fans of SAVAGEHEADS, VAXINE, and the MASSACRED. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Havana Syndrome Kill Your Brain cassette Demented synth punkers HAVANA SYNDROME are back with a quickness after dropping a demo tape in July. Look at the cover art: a brain mainlined into a computer monitor displaying a punk whose face is being eaten by his own brain! Cool. This should give you an idea of what you\u2019re in for. It\u2019s aggressive, it\u2019s fast, and the synths give the songs life through a vein of electro insanity. On songs like \u201cWrapped Boots\u201d and \u201cMind Control,\u201d the vocalist yelps and hollers like a wounded animal around pulsing guitar and synth lines. It would be easy to compare them to bands like RESEARCH REACTOR CORPORATION, but it kicks way more ass. Think LUMPY & THE DUMPERS imprinting onto members of the LOCUST. Pick this up and kill your brain. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Swimming Faith Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Lamictal Lamictal cassette OC punk slop from the future. This is a solo project from Alex Colettogents, who is associated with seizure-core spazzers GNARLES MANSON and X-ACTO. Coming out of this eight-song tape, there is some vertigo and nausea that will take a moment to wear off. Once it does, I can say that there is slight intrigue, egg-punk on 78, dysphonia, a cacophony of eight tracks all barely clocking in at six retching minutes. Is he alone in this chaos? In the end, \u201cCan\u2019t Stand My Dreams\u201d is worthy of note. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Pop Affliction Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Melkus Discografia Due LP Leipzig\u2019s MELKUS has a distinct sound of their own that really enchanted me. Fast and furious sequences that smoothly transition into melodic passages, dark and mysterious garage sounds that get better and better with each layer, and catchy hooks peeking around every corner\u2026it\u2019s one of those albums where every part flows perfectly into the next. While guitar and bass with gloriously filthy tones lock into each other to form amazing riffs, punchy drums not only accompany them but also add another layer of that explosive energy. Charismatic vocals are definitely the cherry on top of this beautiful rock\u2019n\u2019roll cake, along with the momentary bursts of ear-candy from miscellaneous instruments like saxophone, organ, and synths. The dark and gritty production style of this LP complements the band\u2019s sound flawlessly, too. I really like this one, and I\u2019m already looking forward to their next release. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label It's Eleven Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 No Idols The Fall EP Excellent hardcore punk from Baltimore\u2019s NO IDOLS, a band composed of members of ANGEL DU$T, BIB and TRUTH CULT. Muscular and tough as hell, NO IDOLS draw from Feel the Darkness -era POISON IDEA, with catchy leads and heavy riffs galore. You can hear the pedigree behind these songs; they feel a little more complete and pulled together than your usual hardcore fare. One of 2025\u2019s best 7\u201ds. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Plastika Sijamski Blizanac LP PLASTIKA is from Croatia and plays raw, hardcore punk, and Sijamski Blizanac is their ten-track full-length that delivers a noisy pummeling. Think KRIMEWATCH but faster, and oh yeah, the lyrics aren\u2019t in English, but not knowing the words in their native language really doesn\u2019t matter with how tight tracks like \u201cNervoza\u201d and \u201cKaj Sad\u201d are. PLASTIKA has a rare authenticity in their energy which makes their delivery of primitive hardcore that much more enjoyable of a listening experience. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Onesna\u017eevanje Uma Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Saints of Lorain Before We Were Saints cassette Gonna do my best to break this somewhat confusing one down and hope that I\u2019ve got my facts straight. SAINTS OF LORAIN are from Cleveland, OH and put out a digital demo in 2023. This is the second release by the band, a \u201ccollection\u201d of songs which were written by the members\u2019 former band AL & THE COHOLICS (the collection featuring a grand total of six songs). AL & THE COHOLICS formed in 1999, and when the drummer died in 2014, his brother apparently promised to keep the music alive. Fast forward to the present and the brother is the drummer of this band, and the songs that would have been lost to time are now documented. What an absolutely lovely sentiment. Never would I ever have thought that the actions of members of a long-running drunk punk/street punk/pirate-punk band would hit on sentimentality as strong as this. Musically, this is complicated, uptempo slap bass street punk. If you like songs about being drunk, being addicted to drugs, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, or sex, or you were around for the heyday of AL & THE COHOLICS, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna have a great time with this tape. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Small Doses Rodeo EP Pretty nifty record here with plenty of nuances, combining pieces of orgcore (melodic vocals paired with power-chord-driven punk songs \u00e0 la BAD RELIGION and LAGWAGON) with post-hardcore (dissonant chords, slower tempos, and throaty screams that reminds me a lot of POLAR BEAR CLUB if they had embraced more of the Dischord style). I guess you can call this post-orgcore (although I\u2019m not even sure if that term is in vogue anymore). Well-crafted tracks that do a great job telling a narrative\u2014both musically and lyrically\u2014that never once gets boring. Great work here. As far as punk goes, this is as perfect of an EP as you\u2019ll get. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Sn\u00f6rkler Hot Dignity Dog and Other Future Classics cassette Spastic egg-punk is what y\u2019all might call SN\u00d6LKER nowadays, but it was called Very Small Records-esqe back before that term was around. It has all the perfect elements of FALSE SACRAMENT, SCHLONG, NONMEANSNO, or VICTIMS FAMILY, with keyboards for all the sulphur egginess you can handle. Four tunes that clock in under nine minutes, all plopped onto a cassette tape. The coughing on the tune \u201cVape Man\u201d is perfect. Also, I think I\u2019m hearing a flute layered in here. What the fuck is this gorgeous tidal wave of gross perfection called, you ask? I guess it\u2019s called SN\u00d6RKLER. Reviewer Tony Party Label What's For Breakfast? Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 TV Casualties Orphanage Fire CD Self-proclaimed \u201cCanola Hardcore,\u201d whatever the hell that means. This sounds like a band that you saw on the Warped Tour when you were thirteen years old whose name you can\u2019t remember. The EP is self-produced and self-released which is commendable, but the songs are generic and unmemorable. You could put it on in the background and no one will be offended, but no one\u2019s going to ask you who it is, either. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Zlodzieje Rowerow Ka\u017cdy Inny Wszyscy R\u00f3wni EP Melodic yet confrontational punk rock from Poland, rooted in DIY ethics and social awareness. ZLODZIEJE ROWEROW delivers mid-tempo anthems with heartfelt vocals and strong choruses, balancing aggression and melody with ease. The lyrics emphasize equality and solidarity, making this EP both politically charged and emotionally resonant. Punk rock mel\u00f3dico y combativo desde Polonia, con una fuerte base DIY y conciencia social. ZLODZIEJE ROWEROW presentan himnos de medio tiempo con coros s\u00f3lidos y voces cargadas de emoci\u00f3n, equilibrando agresi\u00f3n y melod\u00eda con naturalidad. Las letras giran en torno a la igualdad y la solidaridad, logrando un EP tan pol\u00edtico como emotivo. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Refuse Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 V/A Right on Time Re:imagined LP I try to refrain from using the phrase \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d when writing about music (in real life, I may not apologize enough). But in this case, I can\u2019t conceive of any other way to rationalize how I feel about what I\u2019m duty-bound to say. Right on Time Re:imagined is easily the worst release I\u2019ve had to suffer through listening to in a long, long time. Each and every song is bad, some extraordinarily so. What we have here are six versions of the same song, interpreted by different artists in distinct genres spanning the gamut from \u201cSexy Stoner Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll\u201d to \u201cEmo Pop Punk\u201d and \u201cHeavenly Metal.\u201d There\u2019s even an \u201cUnplugged Hardcore\u201d rendition that is more egregious than whatever you\u2019re imagining. The song that is the basis for such wide and varied explication is a by-the-numbers youth crew ditty called \u201cRight on Time.\u201d As a stand-alone track, it\u2019s a decent slice of impassioned straightedge hardcore, with a message that offers genuine positivity in the face of adversity. And herein lies the source of my initial plea for forgiveness\u2026this whole project is inspired by a member of the band RIGHT ON TIME\u2019s battle against cancer, and is an ode to the support they received from friends in the darkest moments of that experience. Profits from this release support a Dutch foundation, No Guts No Glory, that is dedicated to making the music-related wishes of cancer patients come true. Truly a fantastic cause, and one that I do not wish to denigrate just because I don\u2019t like the music involved. If you dig sXe hardcore and have broad enough interests, this may be right up your alley. In any case, there\u2019s a worthy cause attached to this that makes my snarky take on the tunes irrelevant. Fuck cancer! Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Positive and Focused Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 100 Flowers Presence of Mind EP reissue Shortly after the URINALS changed their name to 100 FLOWERS, they cemented the switch with the release of this artsy 7\u201d in 1982. A bit more explorational than their earlier output, which brought us dum-dum classics like \u201cI\u2019m A Bug\u201d and \u201cAck Ack Ack Ack,\u201d the band\u2019s evolved style on this three-song EP is more in line with the sound of early WIRE and PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED. The dark disco of the title track leads the proceedings, an energetic post-punk number that would eventually make its way onto the group\u2019s LP the following year. Next up, the brief and bouncy \u201cDyslexia\u201d quickly reminds us that we\u2019re still dealing with the same guys that wrote \u201cI Am White and Middle Class.\u201d On the flipside, \u201cMop Dub\u201d is an instrumental backwards treatment of \u201cPresence of Mind,\u201d providing a symmetrical bookend that suits the fashion of the era. Faithfully reissued in its original format, this poignant little slab documents the iconic unit\u2019s transition from weird to weirder. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Spacecase Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Axe Il Cimitero \u00e8 Dappertutto cassette Italy\u2019s Sistema Mortal has had an excellent year, starting off with the head-splitting FARCE 7\u201d and wrapping things up with this killer debut from Milan\u2019s AXE. Featuring two vocalists and a raw, crusty sound, AXE plays with a little more texture and melody (and I think keyboard) than your usual D-beat fare. Opening track \u201cPatto di Sangue\u201d kicks off with an ominously dark tone that quickly morphs into full on m\u00e4ngel fury that doesn\u2019t let up for the entirety of the tape. A total scorcher and highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Sistema Mortal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Billiam The Letter W & the Numeral B EP Melbourne\u2019s BILLIAM is back with another EP, his fourth release this year. There\u2019s nothing new here, and any of the four tracks could have appeared on any of the project\u2019s previous efforts. If you\u2019ve enjoyed any of his other records, you\u2019ll dig this. \u201cNew Wave\u201d and \u201cHouston We Have Rock\u201d are full of fuzzy three-chord punk, battered with synthesizers and left scrambling to catch up to the lo-fi hi-hats working overtime in the background. The vocals sound like they were recorded through a cell phone inside of a cave, which kind of ruins it for me, although repeating the phrase \u201cHouston, we have rock\u201d 16 times in 54 seconds brought a smile to my face. The B-side is more mid-tempo and features the highlight of the EP for me, the closing \u201cEssential Feedstock Oils,\u201d where they repeat the word \u201crecord\u201d 27 times in 90 seconds. Heavy SPARKS vibes with a bedroom charm. It ain\u2019t for me, but fans of 1-800-MIKEY and GEE TEE will eat it up. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Low Ambition Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 C.A.M.O. Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry 12\u2033 If you played this for me and told me it came out in 1985, I\u2019d believe you, but C.A.M.O. out of Vienna, Austria exists in 2025, and thanks to Mendeku Diskak, their cassette Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry is now available as a vinyl disc. Anarcho-punk with a cold bent makes C.A.M.O. sound indignant and haunting, and this eight-song album is full of sonic macabre with ominous lyrics and guitar riffs that sound adjacent to funeral marches. If you dig early KILLING JOKE, 1919, or PART1, then go check out C.A.M.O. right now.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Destroyer :: Destroyer's Rubies Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together In 1976 the granola jazzists teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in the sphere, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal The Lagniappe Sessions :: The Slaps Posted on January 23, 2026 January 22, 2026 Via Chicago, guitarist Rand Kelly, bassist Ramsey Bell, and drummer Josh Resing are The Slaps. Formed in 2017, the genre agnostic trio are constantly in motion, and, more impressively, consistently interesting. This installment of the Lagniappe Sessions finds the band paying tribute to pre- Dark Side era Floyd with a lived-in, and woolly, cover of Obscured by Clouds\u2019 \u201cWot\u2019s\u2026 Uh the Deal\u201d. AD Manna, indeed! And keeping things local, they deliver an amped up version of friend and touring partner hemlock\u2019s \u201cUnder All The Kudzu\u201d \u2026 Evelyne/Maseo :: Testpattern Posted on January 22, 2026 January 21, 2026 Fusing elements of Japanese City Pop, French New Wave, and a touch of Kosmische Musik, Testpattern by Evelyne/Maseo is sonically sublime. Recorded in Maseo Hiruma\u2019s home studio circa mid-80s, the material hits as well as anything coming out of the renowned Yen Records at the time. Fans of Yellow Magic Orchestra are legion, and this recently unearthed addition to the golden era of Japanese electronic music will delight any YMO junkie. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on January 21, 2026 January 19, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Herbie Hancock Septet: Live at the Boardinghouse January 16, 1973 Posted on January 21, 2026 January 21, 2026 Recently, a previously unheard Sextant tour FM broadcast from SF\u2019s legendary Boarding House emerged. It\u2019s well worth your time. This group is especially good when they stretch way way way out. And they certainly do that here: most of the performance is made up of a 40+ minute spiral through \u201cHidden Shadows.\u201d Everyone gets a chance to shine, of course, but let\u2019s give it up for the rhythm section of Buster Williams and Billy Hart, who hold things down and lift things up simultaneously, letting the prog-funk-jazz mutant grooves spin and swirl all around the room. Unreal! Barry Walker, Jr. :: Paleo Sol Posted on January 21, 2026 January 20, 2026 Pedal steel guitarist Barry Walker, Jr. has long spun out his unearthly twangs for rustic psychedelicists like Mouth Painter, North Americans and the Rose City Band. The lingering, shape-shifting overtones that float from his instrument imbue an instant mystery and ambiguity. He puts the \u201ccosmic\u201d in \u201ccosmic country.\u201d Now on this solo album\u2014accompanied by drummer Rob Smith from Animal, Surrender! and Jason Willmon from Mouth Painter\u2014he puts his ineffable sound at center stage, in songs that traverse drone, Americana and Reichian minimalism. The Olympians :: Strawberry Kiwi Posted on January 20, 2026 January 19, 2026 Sometimes things just take time. It\u2019s been a whole decade since The Olympians, the orchestral funk and soul combo led by songwriter Toby Pazner (Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, El Michels Affair) dropped their self-titled debut on Daptone Records. But 2026 sees the group\u2019s long awaited return with In Search of a Revival , due out February 13th on Daptone. Jana Horn :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on January 20, 2026 January 19, 2026 Over the last few years, and now three records, Jana Horn has quietly asserted herself as a songwriter of great merit amongst a vast and seemingly bottomless sea of artists also in search of answers through song. Her most recent LP, a self-titled work written during a period of transition in her life\u2014notably a relocation to New York City having graduated from a writing program in the University of Virginia\u2014captures movement not just in the physical sense of moving from one physical place to another, but of progressing the flow of her interior life. Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo Posted on January 19, 2026 January 19, 2026 In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Mean Red Spiders :: Starsandsons Posted on January 19, 2026 January 19, 2026 Toronto\u2019s Mean Red Spiders released their opus, Starsandsons , in 2000, to little lasting acclaim. On the one hand, the album came too late \u2013 their psychedelic, arty sensibilities were out of sync with the changing tides. On the other hand, it was too early \u2013 critics and fans didn\u2019t have the right language to fully grok what the Mean Red Spiders were on about. But as contemporary \u201cshoegaze\u201d and \u201cdreampop\u201d bands have mined the \u201890s aesthetic for their own sound, it\u2019s given us a newfound appreciation for some overlooked classics, and Starsandsons is ready for a reappraisal. Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard :: January 2026 Posted on January 18, 2026 January 15, 2026 Airing every third Sunday of the month, Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard on dublab features the pairing of Tyler Wilcox\u2019s Doom and Gloom from the Tomb and Chad DePasquale\u2019s New Happy Gathering. This month, Tyler kicks it off with his annual Honey Slides mix of Neil Young oddities with an array of weird/wonderful Shakey covers and Chad follows with an hour of gospel + soul. Sunday, 4-6pm PT. The Lagniappe Sessions :: Trummors/Prairiewolf Posted on January 16, 2026 January 16, 2026 A meeting of the minds. Last year saw Trummors lit out for the territories touring some esoteric, off-the-beaten path venues in Colorado and New Mexico with Prairiewolf. This installment of the Lagniappe Sessions commemorates the experience with the following collaboration of the two bands reimagining early \u201980s George Strait along with a Joni Mitchell chestnut. The Box Set: An Appreciation, Vol. 1 Posted on January 15, 2026 January 16, 2026 The initial standard for a compact disc was 74 minutes. Legend has it the length was decided upon in order to fit all of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony onto a single disc. In terms of format, the\u00a0arrival and adoption of the CD in 1983 changed not only how we listen to recorded music, but how it\u2019s presented as an art form. No longer beholden to the 22 minute confines of a \u201c12 side, artists began experimenting with the medium\u2026 as did labels. Welcome to the first installment of The Box Set: An Appreciation. L\u00f4 Borges: The Sneaker Album Posted on January 14, 2026 January 13, 2026 L\u00f4 Borges was under immense pressure to record his debut record. The eight songs he had co-composed for Clube da Esquina had the luxury of time to gestate and included contributions from many other musicians in the collective. In contrast, L\u00f4 had very little time to compose and record the songs for his debut, which consisted of fifteen brand new songs, nine of which he was the sole composer. Reissued this month via VAMPISOUL.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
