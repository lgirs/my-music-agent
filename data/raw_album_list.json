Facebook Instagram RSS Twitter Powered by Genesis Mayer\u2019s Playlist for Fall/Winter 2025, Part 1 Wednesday, December 10, 2025 By Mayer Danzig Speechwriter, Joelton Mayfield (from the Bloodshot Records release Crowd Pleaser) Joelton Mayfield\u2019s Crowd Pleaser announces itself with purpose: vivid storytelling wrapped in guitars that know when to whisper and when to scream. The dynamics shift constantly\u2014bobbing, weaving, building tension that reverberates from somewhere in the distance before crashing into the present moment. \u201cPretty Linda\u201d offers [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Americana , Pop , Reviews , Rock , Singer/Songwriter , Streams , Videos Tagged With: American Mile , Jade Bird , Joelton Mayfield , John Calvin Abney , Julianna Riolino , Silver Lining , Terra Lightfoot , Trapper Schoepp , William Prince , Zoe Pete Ford Afton Wolfe \u2013 Ophiuchus Thursday, December 04, 2025 By Shawn Underwood I\u2019ve noted before that I\u2019m a fan of concept albums. I have not seen anyone embrace it quite the way Nashville-by-way-of-Mississippi resident Afton Wolfe did on his newest record, Ophiuchus. Each of the 13 songs is associated with one of the 12 well-known signs of the zodiac, plus one for the lesser known Ophiuchus. Then, [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Folk , Reviews , Roots , Singer/Songwriter Tagged With: Afton Wolfe Peace, Twang, and Turkey Grease: A 2025 Thanksgiving Toast to Kathleen Edwards (and Everyone) Thursday, November 27, 2025 By Tom Osborne The turkey\u2019s in the oven, somebody\u2019s hiding the good bourbon, and there\u2019s at least one family member asking, \u201cWait, who is this?\u201d every time a new song comes on. Meanwhile, here in Twangville, we\u2019re doing what we always do: sharing recs, falling in love with new records, and giving thanks for the music that gets us through it all. Filed Under: Reviews Tagged With: Kathleen Edwards GA-20 \u2013 Orphans Wednesday, November 26, 2025 By Bill Wilcox About 12 years ago I caught a Charlie Musselwhite show at Blues Alley, DC\u2019s great jazz club (that occasionally features blues artists lately). Musselwhite of course was great, but the young lead guitarist, Matthew Stubbs, piqued my intrest so much I sought out his early solo albums \u2013 Soul Bender and Medford & Main.

They go to a bluegrass show to hear the performer\u2019s music, whether written by themselves or someone else. So I found it intriguing to listen to Trish Imbrogno\u2019s (aka Trish Plays Bass) debut EP. After 25 years [\u2026] Filed Under: Bluegrass , Reviews Tagged With: Trish Plays Bass The Tasty Kings \u2013 The Kindness of Numbers Thursday, November 13, 2025 By Shawn Underwood I\u2019m not a lawyer, which undoubtedly enables a number of people to sleep better at night. So the difference between a band and a collective is partially lost on me. The one thing that does seem to be the case is that it enables an easier time of rotating musicians in and out of the [\u2026] Filed Under: Reviews Tagged With: The Tasty Kings \u201cI Don\u2019t Like You\u201d \u2013 a Premiere From Low Roller Wednesday, November 12, 2025 By Mayer Danzig Longtime readers know I love a good kiss-off song.\u00a0\u201cI Don\u2019t Like You,\u201d\u00a0the title of Low Roller\u2019s new single, seems prime for the list. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s actually the opposite. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t like you, but I love you anyway,\u201d singer-songwriter Veronica Davila declares.

This is the kind of album that feels like flying across Seven Mile Bridge at night in a hearse with the windows rolled down, narrowly escaping the Devil, yelling \u201cStep On it Skinner!\u201d It\u2019s [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Reviews , Singer/Songwriter Tagged With: Gurf Morlix John Francis O\u2019Mara \u2013 Forbidden Hymns Wednesday, October 29, 2025 By Shawn Underwood The United States\u2019 Bible Belt and the strongholds of American country music share a lot of geographical overlap. Virginian John Francis O\u2019Mara, with his Theology degree and collaborations with Nashville\u2019s finest, including Kenny Vaughn and John Carter Cash, likewise stands firmly planted in both camps.

    "page_text": "Reviews  - Metal Temple Magazine Menu Reviews Interviews Reports News Filters Order by Order by Order by Newest Oldest Best (10 - 1) None Date Range Date Range Date Range Clear Reset All Reviews Canvas Mors Verum When I hear the term Death Metal, I get images of rotting flesh, destruction and death, and even guttural noise. But here, the music was alive\u2026moving, breathing, never standing still. It\u2019s ardent enough for the common fan, but also offers a kaleidoscope of other sounds for those of us looking for something different. De l'Ab\u00eeme au Pl\u00e9r\u00f4me Sanctvs Overall, this was a solid album to listen to. It didn\u2019t necessarily offer anything new to the genre, but you can hear the fire and the passion behind the compositions, as well as the artist\u2019s skills. The Lamentations Forever Autumn \u201cThe Lamentations\u201d is Autumn Ni Dubhghaill\u2019s most stirring release to date, and not just in the emotional or sentimental sense but in a raw and visceral sense as well. Aus uralter Zeit XIV Dark Centuries Five years has been a bit of a wait but then again, the band does measure itself in centuries so I guess I can\u2019t really complain. Tears Sacrifice If you ask me, this Japanese version of SACRIFICE should have been at least as big worldwide as the Canadian Thrash Metal band with the same name. There can\u2019t be any doubt at all that these guys were capable of writing and recording bloody good music. On \u201cTears\u201d that gives us over 44 minutes of beautiful Heavy Metal. Heed The Prophecy (Reissue) Paragon PARAGON is an American band from Springfield in Ohio. These guys only existed from 1987 until 1992/1993, of that no one is exactly sure. In those times they played pure Melodic Progressive US Metal. Apparently, they wanted to sound like some of the big US Progressive Metal bands. Free Fall War Grave The new record by London England thrash metal band\u00a0War Grave, Freewill,\u00a0is nothing short of an [\u2026] Fiery Path Infernal Presence \u201cFiery Path\u201d is traditional Black Metal with direct and punishing guitar riffs, aggressive growls, and blood-freezing melodies Last Light Fades Graves for Gods This was an excellent Doom album. For one, the band\u2019s vision was not just about long songs with slow, heavy beats, because they also added a flair for the psychedelic at times with lead notes, and even keys. This approach kept the dastardly depressing sound more active to the listener, and this is an album that all Doom fans should take a gander at. Let Water Flow Moon Wisdom Overall, this was a decent listening experience, but I just didn\u2019t get a firm enough handle on their sound through 30 minutes of runtime. I also didn\u2019t hear much in the way of Punk or even Gaze sounds. Had they not mentioned that, I probably wouldn\u2019t be as disappointed as I am. The Greatest Gift Of All Stryper This is STRYPER from start to finish. Melodic Heavy Metal/Hard Rock that will have you singing along in no time. La Alma Blossoms Fall It is all just too neat, too controlled. I never get the feeling that the band is throwing everything they have at me, that they are holding back for future references and/or releases. If they are, that\u2019s their bad, because that means that they are forgetting that you can only make a good first impression once. Colors In Grey Oathbound Even though it all sounds rather nice, it also sounds very clean. A little bit too clean for a pure Metalcore band. The thing is that if you add the moniker Melodic in from of it, the whole description would make sense. Not that this is purely Melodic, but it doesn\u2019t go as Hard and Heavy as Metalcore bands usually do. As Mankind Rots Paganizer Because there is no two ways about it; every song that PAGANIZER plays on \u201cAs Mankind Rots\u201d hits the spot just right. In just under 40 minutes time the band has made sure that the songs they write have that underlying tension that comers with the territory, whilst also allowing the listener to adapt to every tune with a great deal of ease. \u00d6r\u00f6kl\u00e9t Witcher I thoroughly enjoyed the sound the band presents on the album. It has that thick darkness of Black Metal with a counterbalance of solemnity. However, besides the final song, the first four had too similar of a sound and it just wasn\u2019t quite diverse enough for me. It\u2019s good, but it could have been excellent with some subtle sound shifting. What The Night Is All About Nite Stinger This is the second album from Nite Stinger who are Hard Rock band from Sao [\u2026] Death Never Sleeps Glorious Depravity The OSDM scene in New York is flourishing because of albums like this. Take It To The Grave Slander Where to start?! \"SLENDER\" is a 5 person band, not to be confused with Slayer, [\u2026] The Word of the Mistral The Lancasters \"THE LANCASTERS\" is a heavy rock, psychedelic, band hailing all the way from Italy and [\u2026] Once In A Blue Moon Civil Daze Civil Daze are a Melodic Rock band who are based in Upplands Vasby,which is just [\u2026] Frozen Halls Soul Grinder Frozen Halls,\u00a0the newest album from Bemen Germany death metal outfit,\u00a0Soul Grinder\u00a0rips the music scene to [\u2026] Maldor\u00f6r Disco Master\u2019s Hammer This was an excellent listening experience for me. As a teenager in the 80\u2019s, its lush electronic sound took me back to some of the music I enjoyed at that time, and keyboards are always a welcomed instrument for me. Here, you will find plenty, combined with gritty riffs and vocals, and the songs were downright catchy. Con Man's Chronicles The Skelters This is Hard Rock at best, but it is the variety that will transport you back to the seventies in sound as well as atmosphere and feel. That can be a good thing nowadays, as it gives the whole listening experience a much more analogue and therefore honest approach. In that respect THE SKELTERS got everything just right. Next Akin To Chaos Sterbhaus Musically you can place STERBHAUS as a Thrash/Death Metal band, and that is as accurate as you can get. And if you ask me, for a trio they are able to make a lot of sensible noise, as that is what has impressed me most about \u201cNext Akin To Chaos\u201d. Stardust Speedclaw Even though \u201cStardust\u201d will never be my favourite album of all time, it is one that I will treasure and enjoy when I hear it passing me by. It just confirms to me that SPEEDCLAW have done good in choosing this as their musical direction. Eternal Return To Darkness What RETURN TO DARKNESS does is be themselves, to play the kind of music they like, without trying to emulate or copy their peers in any way or form. And what they have produced has been brought together on \u201cEternal\u201d. Bloody good stuff, if you ask me. Celestial Clear Moonlit Storming The information in the bio is indeed what you will find on the album. The hypnotic gaze of many of the songs does create a shimmering effect, but the production is so raw it takes away from my enjoyment. It does have peaks of intrigue, but four of the five songs also have a similar sound that is hard to distinguish. The Graves and Ghosts of Yore Deogen Overall, this was a solid album. Black Metal can really push the limits of aggressiveness and rage, but sometimes you need pauses to them, and the album does a nice job of balancing both. The Endchanter Araphel Overall, this was a solid listen for me. It wasn\u2019t necessarily anything new, or even out of the box, but the band presented some somber melodies along with a heaping of darkness and aggression, and that balance created an enjoyable listening experience. Seitsem\u00e4n soihdun valossa Victimarum Overall, this was an album that just burned from start to finish, and \u201cmelancholy misery\u201d is an apt word for the collection of songs. A little more diversity could have taken the album further, but I admire their commitment to their sound. Fire & Ice (single) Rozario \u201cFire & Ice\u201d is the first single/video from the highly anticipated new album from the hard rocking Norwegian band ROZARIO With Guts And Glory Centinex I have to say that after listening to \u201cWith Guts And Glory\u201d I was disappointed that there weren\u2019t any more songs on the album. I feel that with less than half an hour of new discoveries the audience could feel they deserved a few more tunes. Silicon Tea Evil Scarecrow Did you know that submarines can have feelings too? Well, if you listen to opener \u201cNuclear Fallout Machine Sentience\u201d the band will set you straight on that one Stronghold Human Fortress Musically there is no way around the way HUMAN FORTRESS plays their music. this is Epic, this is Power Metal, and these guys are very well-equipped to bend what they make into a shape that fits them down to a T. There isn\u2019t a song that doesn\u2019t fit, there is no note that has been put wrong, there are no mistakes or mishaps on \u201cStronghold\u201d. Severance Jet Jaguar While the songs are clearly the most important part of the process when they write their music, they also never forget to have fun while doing so. That makes that especially guitarist Ariyuki Saddler gets the chance to demonstrate his techniques. The Purest Ending Sainte Obyana Du Froid One of the best parts of the album, besides the themes matching the music very well, is that despite the length of the songs you don\u2019t notice them passing by for so long. Indeed, the album does a nice job of pulling in the listener into its cold, winter sound, and immersing you in its imagery. Although it\u2019s a barren and freezing landscape, it\u2019s also something that I now want to experience for myself. More results...

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

Everyone has their favourite records of course; but FFAK\u2019s discography is one that I\u2019ve majorly only heard praise for and considering they\u2019re coming up on their 8th full-length album; that isn\u2019t something you find in a whole lot of bands. They have continuously tweaked and polished their sound without straying too far from their strengths and this remains the case for their upcoming LP Lonely God. The record contains everything their fans would want out of a FFAK project and more, finding the band not only in a stride but with the addition of some new flavours as well. 1 2 3 - 104 >> Please leave this field empty SUBSCRIBE We keep your data private and share your data only with third parties that make this service possible.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Dying Wish \u2013 Flesh Stays Together [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Lavender Larcenist on December 16, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Hardcore , Metalcore , 16 comments Here we go again, another day, another genre that generally gets written off by the metal faithful. Metalcore is a gateway for many metalheads, but it rarely has staying power past those formative years. I had the opposite experience, and only really found metalcore that I enjoyed well into my heavy music tenure. Dying Wish is one of those bands that dug its way out of the pit and drilled its way into my brain. The band\u2019s latest album, Flesh Stays Together , is an emotionally charged ripper filled with catchy hooks, vicious breakdowns, and a manic energy more akin to acts like Venom Prison than its contemporaries. Flesh is a gift. Between the Buried and Me \u2013 The Blue Nowhere [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Samguineous Maximus on December 16, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Metalcore , Progressive Metal , Progressive Rock , 20 comments \u201cWith their move to Inside Out Music and the departure of longtime guitarist Dusty Waring, another shift seemed inevitable, with longtime fans like me wondering if the band could deliver another impressive offering. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to say The Blue Nowhere sticks the landing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an impressive record that finds BTBAM confident, energized, and willing to explore new ideas while refining the familiar.\u201d The grave digging was premature. House by the Cemetary \u2013 Disturbing the Cenotaph Review By Tyme on December 16, 2025 in Reviews , Death Metal , 2 comments \u201cFrom Imperial Doom to The Passage of Existence , Monstrosity has one of the most solid death metal discographies on record. And while I\u2019ve always gravitated toward those early Corpsegrinder albums, the performance Mike Hrubovcak turned in on The Passage of Existence was brutally good. Now, when he\u2019s not creating sick cover art or contributing to his other projects\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Azure Emote , Hypoxia , or Imperial Crystalline Entombment \u00e2\u0080\u0094Hrubovcak partners with the inimitable, no-band-too-big-or-small-for-me-to-play-in, personal injury lawyer guitarist Rogga Johannson to front House by the Cemetary .\u201d Taste the grave.

Rotten Sound \u2013 Mass Extinction EP Review By Saunders on December 15, 2025 in Reviews , 4 comments \u201cWe may be swinging into the festive season; however, in a solidly fruitful year for grindcore enthusiasts, there is still much time to grind. Rocketing in late, Finland\u2019s legendary Rotten Sound , one of grind\u2019s most prolific, consistent, and underappreciated acts, return with their whopping 11th EP and follow-up to their eighth full-length, 2023\u2019s Apocalypse . At this stage of a long and storied career, Rotten Sound revel in familiar realms of their crusty, grinding chaos, refusing to budge from a steadfast formula, while sounding as tight, energized, and pissed off as ever, impressively plying such an abrasive trade of extremity for over three decades. With scant time to get their point across, can Rotten Sound continue their impeccable track record?\u201d Something\u2019s rotten in Finland. Upon a Burning Body \u2013 Blood of the Bull Review By Dear Hollow on December 14, 2025 in Reviews , Deathcore , Groove Metal , Metalcore , 12 comments \u201c Upon a Burning Body is back, baby. Your favorite groovy Texans are ready to lay on the hurt with as many riffs as your ears can muster. Predecessor 2022\u2019s Fury offered a no-frills attack that more substantially simplified the attack, recalling more the groove-oriented likes of Pantera or Lamb of God , as opposed to the longstanding comparisons to deathcore\u2019s partyharders Attila and \u201cfight everyone\u201d breakdowners Emmure to whom they\u2019ve been compared in the past.\u201d Tastes like burning. Blood, Bonds, and Bitterness: the Perverse Pervasiveness of the the Re-Recording of Bonded by Blood By Steel Druhm on December 13, 2025 in Blog Posts , Thrash Metal , 99 comments Join Steel Druhm and his ever-greasy sidekick Doc Grier as they second-guess Exodus and ask why anyone would choose to listen to the re-recording of Bonded by Blood willingly. Pedestal for Leviathan \u2013 Enter: Vampyric Manifestation Review By Kenstrosity on December 12, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Metal , Symphonic Metal , 22 comments \u201cDepending on what you already know about the castle to your left and what it holds, this review will either come late, very late, or right on time (read: actually on time or only slightly late). That\u2019s because Colorado\u2019s goth-soaked symphonic brutal death upstarts Pedestal for Leviathan originally self-released their debut LP, Enter: Vampyric Manifestation , on Halloween. In short order, it was picked up for distro by Gurgling Gore Productions, who released it again digitally on November 14th (with physical cassettes dropping December 12th). Then, Personal Records also picked it up for yet another digi release, along with a compact disc release, set for December 12th. Having none of this information prior to picking up Personal Records\u2019 promo for review, needless to say, I was confused and frustrated. However, Enter: Vampyric Manifestation was simply too cool not to write about, so here we are.\u201d Pedestal pushing. Weeping Sores \u2013 The Convalescence Agonies [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Creeping Ivy on December 12, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Death Doom , Death Metal , Doom Metal , 25 comments \u201cPleasure\u00e2\u0080\u0094as Judas Priest , sadomasochists, and Flagellants teach us\u00e2\u0080\u0094can be found in pain. Doug Moore and Stephen Schwegler, the guitar/drum duo behind Weeping Sores , also teach this lesson with The Convalescence Agonies . As its title suggests, the sophomore Weeping Sores album chronicles Moore\u2019s recovery from a shoulder injury that, quite unfortunately, prevented him from playing guitar. Quite fortunately for us, Moore sublimates his agony into the listener\u2019s ecstasy with The Convalescence Agonies .\u201d Art requires pain. Primitive Man \u2013 Observance [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Spicie Forrest on December 11, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Death Metal , Doom Metal , Noise , Sludge , 27 comments \u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a decade since Primitive Man last graced these halls with 2015\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tepidly received Home is Where the Hatred Is , but they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been idle. In the meantime, the Denver trio has released 2 LPs, a full-length EP, a split with Unearthly Trance , and a collab with Full of Hell . Those ten years were spent experimenting, learning, and honing their sound into something so incredibly bleak that not even the promo pit could contain such hopeless darkness.\u201d Man against earlier man.

Axe Collector Unforced Damage EP Human Future continues to prove why they\u2019re one of the most exciting labels in today\u2019s hardcore landscape. Evil-driven AXE COLLECTOR unleashes a full-force EP of ripping, steel-cut aggression: sharp riffs, collapsing-wall drums, and vocals that spit fire without a pause. Every track hits like a thrown brick\u2014fast, raw, and absolutely determined. Fury with intention, nothing sloppy, all deadly precise. Hardcore with no filler, no posturing. A record that feels urgent, necessary, alive, like it was tracked inside a street riot. One of my favorites this month. Human Future contin\u00faa demostrando por qu\u00e9 es uno de los sellos m\u00e1s emocionantes del circuito hardcore actual. Guiados por una fuerza maligna, AXE COLLECTOR entrega un EP que es pura metralla: riffs filosos, bater\u00edas que parecen detonar paredes y una voz que te escupe la realidad sin descanso. Cada tema cae como un ladrillazo\u2014r\u00e1pido, crudo, decidido. Hay furia, pero tambi\u00e9n claridad en la ejecuci\u00f3n, nada suena atolondrado, todo est\u00e1 apuntado a matar. Hardcore sin relleno, sin poses, sin descanso. Un disco que se siente urgente y necesario, como si estuviese grabado en medio de un incendio en una manifestaci\u00f3n. Uno de mis favoritos del mes. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Extinction Burst / Human Future Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Ayucaba Operaci\u00f3n Masacre LP Here\u2019s a searing debut from this Barcelona powerhouse. Featuring members of killer bands like MURO and INYECCION, the bar for this slab is quite high, but goddamn, my expectations were fully exceeded. Not unlike INYECCION, there\u2019s a prominent UK82 backbone, yet AYUCABA eschews the street punk bent for metal leanings in a BROKEN BONES kind of way. Ripping solos, chaotic, thrashy riffage \u00e0 la BLACK UNIFORMS, Operaci\u00f3n Masacre is a behemoth album. Impressive instrumentation is bolstered by straight evil vocals, launching this into a whole other galaxy. This whispered part of the opener \u201cSistema Siniestro\u201d has Sakevi vibes, and there are nods to Japanese hardcore found throughout the album\u2019s ten tracks. A potent formula executed with deftness and precision. Can\u2019t seem to keep this one off the turntable. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Metadona Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Body Minus Head An Exercise in Self-Sufficiency LP BODY MINUS HEAD hail from Kitchener, Ontario, and play a blend of hardcore and crust punk that is emotive and gnarly. On An Exercise in Self-Sufficiency , the first full-length by the band, you\u2019ll find vocal blasts that give goosebumps, guitar licks that make you say \u201chell yeah,\u201d and a rumbly rhythm section that gets your head nodding. The majority of the songs on this ten-track album are over in less than two minutes each, so you know BODY MINUS HEAD isn\u2019t wasting time noodling around, and most of the songs hit so hard you may experience shellshock. Tracks like \u201cReset to Factory Default\u201d and \u201cUnconditional\u201d are full-on sonic pummelings, while the lyrics speak truths about the failures of the human condition. If you\u2019ve ever listened to MURDERESS\u2019s The Last Thing You Will Ever See\u2026 and said to yourself, \u201cThis could be heavier and faster,\u201d then you should absolutely check out BODY MINUS HEAD. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label No Funeral Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Citric Dummies Split With Turnstile LP Minneapolis cut-ups CITRIC DUMMIES return with their fourth LP, Split With Turnstile , which\u2014consider yourself warned\u2014is not a split with TURNSTILE at all. They put up a snotty front, but all hijinks aside, across eleven high-energy songs in twenty minutes they blast out buoyant, tongue-in-cheek punk propelled by D.V. Tinner\u2019s hyperactive drumming. It\u2019s fast without tipping into hardcore, landing somewhere between the BROKEDOWNS and DEAN DIRG. My buddy Tom says parts of it sound like a less crusty ANNIHILATION TIME, and he\u2019s not wrong. Even when they\u2019re yelling \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Anything,\u201d the whole thing still bursts with this dumb, irresistible sense of fun. I fucking love this record. Immediate top ten material. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Feel It Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Die Benjamins In 10 Jahren / Pas de Deux 7\u2033 Synth-spiked German post-punk casting backwards glances to the pop-leaning (but still properly asymmetrical) side of the Neue Deutsche Welle\u2014think \u00d6STRO 430, IDEAL, NEONBABIES, etc. That was enough to pique my interest after cueing this single up with zero background context, so imagine my surprise when I clocked that DIE BENJAMINS\u2019 vocalist Annette Benjamin was the same Annette who had been the singer (and occasional saxophonist) for late \u201970s/early \u201980s femme-punk paragons HANS-A-PLAST! Her voice is as powerful as ever here, with all of the shouty defiance and boundless energy that made \u201cRank Xerox\u201d and \u201cSex Sex Sex\u201d such indelible rippers, but while these two songs are clearly informed by her musical past, they\u2019re definitely not shackled to it. Thick, distorted bass drives the quirky/arty A-side \u201cIn 10 Jahren,\u201d periodically dissolving into washes of echoing electronics straight out of the modern Leipzig school (not unlike a punchier/less coolly detached MARAUDEUR), with the darker and more desperate atmosphere of B-side \u201cPas de Deux\u201d only heightened by Annette\u2019s soaring, passionate pleads. Totally unexpected, in the best way. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Tomatenplatten Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 East End Redemption Crashing Down LP Pop punk out of Maine that combines the melodic sensibilities of your average RAMONES-core outing with a hint of early PROPAGHANDI\u2014mainly in the vocals. In other words, this sounds like it came straight from the early years of Fat Wreck Chords. Good mixture of lighthearted lyrics paired with dystopian themes, specifically with tracks like \u201cLost Town\u201d and \u201cLacking Motivation.\u201d Nothing groundbreaking here, but it really scratches that itch if you\u2019re a fan of this era of punk. I would be remiss not to mention how great the bass tone is on this here slab. Solid production all around, actually. In my research, I came across a recycling center of the same name from the same town the group calls home. I love when bands pull their monikers from shit like that. Fantastic stuff, and would recommend for a couple spins. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Crack Rock Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Fen Fen In Yer Sights 12\u2033 Pumping stripped-down and rugged rock into the Motor City, FEN FEN unleashes a tough rip of tunes on their debut 12\u2033. Loaded with foreboding riffs and catchy lyrics, the songs are propelled by a triumphant power, at times coming across like a warped version of the HIVES. Snappy and snotty, its clean aggression makes for pure punk catharsis. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Low Ambition / Sweet Time Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Fog Spring EP FOG is a four-piece anarcho-punk band that has been very active for the past couple of years. The band\u2019s latest release, Spring , is a four-track EP that takes a hard look at the genocide of Palestinian people in Gaza with poetic and articulate lyrics. Sonically, FOG reminds me a lot of France\u2019s TOXIC RITES, with fast-paced, quick-switch punk rock forming a backdrop to the vocals. When compared to FOG\u2019s previous output, Spring comes out feeling more focused with its concise lyrical theme. The closer \u201cNo Fate\u201d is perhaps my favorite song on the EP, as it lets the instrumentals come through fully and has a playful energy while still being serious as hell. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label AlwaysNeverFun / R.I.P. Peace Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Gerinc Reklam\u00e1ci\u00f3 cassette Not everyone has an ear for melody, but certainly everyone in this group does. The guitars have a satisfying crunch, interplaying with the bass in a way that surpasses the bare minimum root note playing most punk asks of its players. In just eight brief tracks, this international Budapest-headquartered band shows a refined and biting sound brimming with harmonic turns that keep the ear on end. Citing the iconic WIPERS as a reference, tracks like \u201cDolgozz\u201d earn the right to the influence, with downpicked chugging that gives way to Greg Sage-like chiming open chords, to say nothing of \u201cMindent Belep\u201d which all but echoes the opening arpeggios of \u201cD-7.\u201d But the sound is novel and all their own. The energy never lets up, with earnest, ganged-up vocals and a drummer who keeps it close and tight. An immensely satisfying listen. Grab a tape while they\u2019re still around (they won\u2019t be for long). Reviewer Luke Henley Label Sz\u00e9gyen Kazett\u00e1k Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Hurt Hawks The Big Sweat cassette Ever wonder what it would sound like if Charles Bukowski had a Casio keyboard? Oh, are you ever in luck. HURT HAWKS are here to spit gravelly, liquor-soaked tales of debauchery and hard living in your face, accompanied by a drum preset. The opening track goes something like this: \u201cLibation! / Liberation! / The last mad days of a hedonist / If you want to bitch about it / Dial 1-800-Eat-Shit!\u201d The next track features the chant, \u201cBad whiskey, bad women, bad sex / My goddamn life is rudderless.\u201d Reading these lines, you are either snapping your fingers at your new favorite tough guy poet laureate, or rolling your eyes back into your skull like a slot machine. That\u2019s really all you need to know. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Rad Safari Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Icks The Icks cassette Five tracks of fuzzed-out, overblown four-track fidelity, with bratty vocals and drenched in Florida humidity. The ICKS ride the line between angular, fuzzed-out punk and slow and gritty mid-tempo bore-core. \u201cIDMTMTM\u201d is killer and will end up on a mixtape or two. If the tape ended here, I would love it, but they use the dreaded disco beat to lead off the next song, and that is an automatic point deduction from me. This would be best played loud while skating curbs in your local cul-de-sac, or taking resin hits from a dirty bong. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Rip Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Kibera / Solit\u00e4r split LP In sci-fi movies, especially in the \u201980s, time machines are always a big deal: incredible technological feats involving years of studies, vast amounts of unstable nuclear energy, and the possibility of changing the course of history. Listening to KIBERA is a much safer way to travel back in time, although it will not get you farther than the mid-\u201900s crust dimension. This Czech band plays raw, dark, and aggressive neocrust with harsh female vocals. I am definitely reminded of bands like AMBULANCE, EKKAIA, or even SCHIFOSI, back when the core of the subgenre still relied on the punkier, more direct side of the spectrum rather than the more emotional or polished \u201cpost-hardcore\u201d one. The six songs on this LP are firmly rooted in primitive, angry hardcore, and the listening experience is therefore pleasant if you like depressive crust. KIBERA shares the split with SOLIT\u00c4R, a rather new Prague-based unit that delivers direct, fast, and furious crustcore. Of course with a name like this, it\u2019s hard not to get the heavy nod: yes, these people are into TOTALIT\u00c4R. But, even though there is an influence (especially riff-wise), I would not place the band in the k\u00e4ng drawer overall, but clearly in the crust basement. There is a lot of energy on this recording, and it certainly more than makes up for some moments that don\u2019t totally work for me. The relentless feel really works well here, and on that level I am reminded of bands like INFEKCJA, local classics like MASS GENOCIDE PROCESS or even MASSGRAVE, or some Brazilian thrashing hardcore at times (because of the fast-paced vocals, probably). On the whole, a solid split LP, and a relevant display of fast and aggressive punk music from Czechia. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Crust as Fuck / Phobia / Svab Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Lebende Tiere Uwaga cassette New release on Berlin, Germany\u2019s Flennen label from LEBENDE TIERE with their Uwaga cassette.\u00a0 From what I can tell, this is the band\u2019s debut, and I assume they are also from Berlin?\u00a0 The songs are fun and fast, featuring bouncy drums and bass, and higher-register guitar tones with a perfect amount of crunch that squabble in some forever-turmoil under the shouted direction of a lively vocalist.\u00a0 Everything feels electric, frantic, and\u2026a little odd or eggy? For example, the vocals in \u201cAchtung Pferde\u201d are replaced by the neighs and whinnies of a horse.\u00a0 So that\u2019s fun. They may have had me with the red-on-pink cassette jacket, but the music rips, too! Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Flennen Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Middle-Aged Queers Theatre of Shame CD I guess this might be the feel-good, laugh-steady queer punk album of the year, unless there\u2019s another one. These are catchy songs, not unlike PANSY DIVISION or some DIESEL QUEENS tunes. Among the laughs and fun-time-party-guy stuff, the MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS pepper in some lyrically heavy songs, exemplified by the tunes \u201cBig Sisters\u201d and \u201cNobody Wants.\u201d I initially was ready to toss this into the WEIRD AL punk category, but MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS have more than that to offer. Look, WEIRD AL punk is a fine place to be, I like a lot of it, but all I\u2019m saying is that MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS have more than just songs funny about slumber parties, kinks, and anal beads. And just in time for Xmas, the MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS have a fully stocked online merch presence! Reviewer Tony Party Label Engineer / Sell the Heart Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Nape Neck The Shallowest End LP I won\u2019t beat around the bush, folks\u2014Leeds trio NAPE NECK\u2019s first LP The Shallowest End utterly and totally stunned me. This thing is a perfect mess of puzzling bass lines, proudly no wave guitars, and incredibly fucked-up drum beats. What\u2019s crazier is the fact that all three members are singing while breezing through those dazzling signature changes and sharp turns in composition. I mean, how? How is it possible for three people to make that much noise and make it make sense? It\u2019s an absolutely explosive and electrifying noise rock freakout, and I\u2019m head over heels in love with it. Ring-ring : Hey Alex, I know I already submitted it, but is it possible to make a few changes to my year-end top ten? Reviewer Mama Goblin Label Dot Dash Sounds / OCCii / Red Wig Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Problem With Kids Today Take It! CD These guys come out of the gates swinging, with some straightforward, melodic, and catchy punk\u2019n\u2019roll. When the vocals themselves are melodic and also a group effort, I just find that kind of infectious. There\u2019s a rawness that reminds me of early REPLACEMENTS, without really having that sound. It\u2019s just the energy. But then they take a different turn and sound almost like the CLEAN. Towards the end, they put together back-to-back-to-back songs all under a minute each. That\u2019s how to win my heart. Excellent album. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label In the Shed Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Reds The Truth of Impermanence 12\u2033 REDS! Liked the movie, love the band. Full disclosure, I have known these folks for some time and we cut our teeth on the same kinds of punk rock. Kids of the \u201990s, I tell ya. This new release is called The Truth of Impermanence , and it is out on Council Records. \u201cSo You Say\u201d showcases vocalist Evan Kilgore\u2019s sass and snarl, with quiet vocals reminiscent of some of my favorite Ian MacKaye vocals both in FUGAZI and MINOR THREAT. This record is quite polished in terms of production, but the essence of punk is foregrounded and intact. \u201cEnergy\u201d reminds me a lot of my favorite Louisville bands, and the first couple of guitar and vocal lines reached into my core, surprising me with how emotional it made me. There are creative and inventive bass lines peppered throughout, as well as driving, solid drumming. Some of my favorite patterns emerge in the song \u201cThe Body,\u201d with well-placed call-and-response instrumentation and noodling. These are the anthems I think we all need in these times, especially as they relate to human dignity and bodily autonomy themes. The treble at the end along with Evan\u2019s shouts makes me wanna punch a fist in the sky. Fans of Dischord will like REDS, and fans of liberation writ large will find something in this as well. Reviewer Katy Otto Label Council Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Sin\ua4d8s Pleasure to Burn EP The A-side is a slow-burner that doesn\u2019t really hold my interest. The B-side has two more punk\u2019n\u2019roll tunes that are a bit faster but still not very interesting to me. These three tunes feel a bit uninspired, which seems weird since the members have been in bands such as POISON IDEA, SMEGMA, OILY BLOODMEN, EXACERBATORS, LOVESORES, and so on. I guess I\u2019m a bit surprised by the lack of impact. Reviewer Tony Party Label Sonic Jett Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Sleeveens Downtown / Drowning 7\u2033 The hits keep on coming for the SLEEVEENS. The latest offering from this Nashville/Dublin combo shows their continued ability to take three-minute songs and make them feel like epic journeys. A lot of this amplification and magnification of sounds and sensations surely comes first from the emotive vocal delivery, but the instrumentation across the board definitely bears load on these creations. \u201cDowntown\u201d specifically just feels larger than life, and also shows that the band is really finding their sweet spot. Their first single, \u201cGive My Regards to the Dancing Girls,\u201d was an awesome way to debut their sound, but it did leave me wondering a bit about the decision of the over-five-minute runtime. When the song appeared again as the opening track to their debut full-length, the track was cut down by almost three minutes, which then ironically left me wondering about all that was left off of it. The three-minute runtime of \u201cDowntown\u201d hits every note with every second sounding vital, surely pleasing even the fussiest of the punk rock Goldilockses. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Goner Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Spatter Pattern Atomic Dinette / TV Casualty 7\u2033 Two tracks of DIY minimal synth punk from Michigan. Both sides throb with thick, warmly produced synth tones, crisp drum machines, and cynical spoken/sung vocals. \u201cTV Casualty\u201d got a few extra plays due to its noisy buzzing frequencies that accompany the main dancefloor rhythm and infectious chorus railing against the influence of television (a quaint concern these days). Bleak, catchy, and worth a listen. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Mutated Pink Fuzz Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Sweepers Sweepers cassette Self-released cassette version of an LP released on Abandon Everything Records. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was this confused by a band. A novelty punk project about sweeping? I guess it\u2019s impressive that one can write that many songs about sweeping. Between this full-length recording and the band\u2019s initial demo, that\u2019s over 25 songs, of which the only subject matter seems to be\u2026sweeping. Hell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve swept the floors of my house as many times as this band has songs about the act of sweeping. To make it all that much more confusing, musically this is something of an artsy free jazz project, wrapped in novelty punk packaging. Maybe I\u2019m the wrong person for this kind of \u201cpunk.\u201d Halfway into this band\u2019s eighteen-song LP (too long), and I\u2019m ready to sweep this under the damn rug. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Toy Tiger Meow Sabotage LP TOY TIGER, a DIY five-piece from Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside, dish out \u201970s glam- and Oi!-influenced street rock built around steady, down-the-middle playing and explicitly anti-racist, anti-authoritarian, pro-LGBTQ2+ lyrics. Meow Sabotage , their second full-length, sticks to that formula and spends most of its time parked in the same mid-tempo lane. The overall effect reminded me more of \u201980s L.A. sleaze rock\u2014like they could have opened for FASTER PUSSYCAT on the Strip\u2014than T. REX\u2019s shimmer. Nothing here knocked me sideways, and a lot of the tracks blur together, but Bugsy Faithfull\u2019s vocals were a standout, shifting between a controlled street punk snarl and a \u201950s-tinged Danzig croon. I have a feeling these songs hit harder when you\u2019re shoulder-to-shoulder in a bar, singing along and getting swept up in the message with the people around you. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Street Rats Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Who Pays Hard Times EP What a year for NYC\u2019s WHO PAYS\u2014they wrecked stages across the country, dropped this killer EP, and (checking notes) loaned Captain Sensible a pair of pants. Anyway, that new EP, Hard Times , features five original cuts of powerhouse HC and an equally aggro BABY HUEY cover. They sort of remind me of Cleveland\u2019s INMATES if they traded the AGNOSTIC FRONT influence for POISON IDEA. You get the picture, this thing fuckin\u2019 rocks. Highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label 11 PM Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 V/A Somos El Peligro Social: Un Homenaje a Ultimo Resorte LP Seminal early \u201980s act ULTIMO RESORT left a lasting impact on not just their home turf of Barcelona, but on Spanish punk as a whole, which would explain the wide scope of groups united in homage on this sprawling tribute album. During their original run spanning from 1979 to 1984, the band channeled numerous styles, ranging from speedy hardcore to anthemic UK82, and the lineup of groups covering them here is equally diverse. Everybody from the ass-kicking DISTHROAT to technopunk experimenters ECM showed up to drop a track and pay respect. There are 24 tracks in total, packaged with a poster in this fitting follow-up to the retrospective LP that came out in 2023. Reviewer Jason Harding Label 16 Forever / BCore / Little Jan's Hammer / Victim / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Action Party The Action Party CD The ACTION PARTY is a tepid rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. Maybe you could say this is like a flaccid JONESES and stuff like that. I\u2019m betting their shows are a rocking good time, maybe. I\u2019m not sure this was quite the right place to send this for review. This is fine, well-produced rock\u2019n\u2019roll that might fit in better on a \u201cBest of the \u201890s\u201d college/alternative rock CD.I guess the one positive thing I can say is that I dozed off a couple times while listening to this, so if you are a little sleep-deprived, then this is the CD for you. Reviewer Tony Party Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Bahia de Kotxinos Bahia Kotxinos LP This is a strange piece of ephemera; a long-abandoned debut by Euskara band BAHIA DE KOTXINOS, who by all accounts were a leading light in an active scene and had a record ready to go that was left on the shelf, gathering Basque dust for the next 30 years. Now lovingly remastered and released into the world, it\u2019s a peculiar document of a very specific scene. It has the taut, frantic energy of yer DEVOs, yer WIREs, yer ADVERTS of the world. However, it also has the sort of wacky, clever-dick stylings of a kind of proto-egg-punk too, which is unfortunate. It\u2019s certainly a lot more interesting than I was anticipating, and well worth your time, albeit three whole decades later than you should have enjoyed it. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Discos Enfermos / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Bootcamp Time\u2019s Up LP Who doesn\u2019t like a great hardcore record that makes one punch a hole through a wall? Strap on your boots, because it\u2019s time to slam with Iowa City\u2019s BOOTCAMP. Proper USHC delivered in an intense manner, sounding fresh but remaining true to the classic tropes. You will find them on the same record store shelf as ARMOR and some of the 11 PM releases. Time\u2019s Up , go listen to this! Now! Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Convulse Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Dick Spikie Ultra Punk 4Cycle Vol. 1 EP Three fantastic Japanese Oi! tracks that will bring you to your feet to pogo with the best of them. Much like the BUSINESS and BLITZ, this trio of D-beat classics are equal parts catchy and rowdy as hell. \u201cRestriction & Freedom\u201d is the cream of this crop, an earworm that led me to spinning the A-side quite a few times. On the B-side, we have a song called \u201cYou\u2019re a Bastard\u201d that features some of my favorite lyrics of the year. Here\u2019s a taste: \u201cYou\u2019re a bastard / Wipe your arse yourself.\u201d Fair enough. For my money, Japanese Oi! has always sounded the most authentic, and this is no different. Grab this slab today! Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Private Scandal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Erosion Invasive Species LP The perceived amount of bands can often feel staggering in the internet age, and as much as you try to keep in tune with new releases, it feels like an impossible task that even a mythological hero would fail to complete. I normally feel comfortable among crust-related bands, so if even I have never heard of EROSION, I am not lost as far as what they are trying to achieve is concerned. In fact, besides MASSGRAVE, I have to admit that I don\u2019t know any of the bands the members of EROSION have been or currently are involved in. Who said the world was small? If EROSION includes a Swedish-flavoured dark metallic crust influence, I would not put them fully in the crust category. A lot is happening on their second LP Invasive Species , sometimes too much so for my basic brain, as this Vancouver act also incorporates elements of extreme metal (black or death) into their behemoth recipe that borders on blackened crust. The record is punishing, heavy, and mean, no doubt about it, and will appeal to metalheads and fans of modern crust alike. The label Mechanized Apparatus Revolt rightly compares them to MARTYRD\u00d6D, but they are more versatile and diverse. I would also add k\u00e4ng-driven metal bands like ADRESTIA adopting a blackened HIS HERO IS GONE approach (assuming that makes sense). It\u2019s a little too technical at times, and sometimes I have the impression that the band wants to do too many things in their songs. However, the sound is great and crushing, definitely an intense listen. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Mechanized Apparatus Revolt Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Frente Norte / The Old Breed split EP Broadly fine split between two Midwestern street punk-y types. My heart initially sank when I saw the cover and bore witness to not one but two fellas wearing the kind of daft flat cap only seen in Peaky Blinders , or on a Victorian chimney sweep or a fight at Cheltenham races, which is usually the sign of the worst kind plodding, midtempo, faux Oi! shite that makes me wish for an inner ear infection, but I was mostly pleasantly surprised. FRENTE NORTE, the stronger side of the split for sure, comes across like a janglier, more pop-oriented FUERZA BRUTA. OLD BREED\u2019s side is boring as fuck but not offensive; can always use that side of the split as a coaster or something. Reviewer Jason Harding Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Gnats Gnats demo cassette First demo from Florida-based, self-proclaimed bubblegum rock band. It\u2019s a little confusing reviewing a band\u2019s first release, which is a year-and-a-half old, when the band has dropped two releases since, but we happily write about what is assigned to us. Six tracks of lo-fi drum machine music with a keyboard seemingly set to emulate the sound of a swarm of bugs, hence the band\u2019s name. That\u2019s a funny idea and all, but not all ideas seem worth following through to fruition. This just comes off sounding like someone is badly playing a slide whistle over all of the songs, some of which actually seem well-crafted and have a fair amount of pop sensibility to them. The final song, \u201cSerial Mom,\u201d is really cool and driving right up until the point that the swarm of slide whistles comes in. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a stupid-sounding synth, but this reoccurring aspect through all six songs is just too commanding and makes the songs hopefully forgettable. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Rip Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Gruntwork Violence in the Workplace cassette Noise-addled, shit-fi punk that just might drive ya to the brink of homicidal rage if you\u2019re listening too close in proximity to your place of employment. Four snappy, over-before-you-know-it jammers that kick harder than your grandpappy\u2019s shotgun, this whole affair will take up less than five minutes of your precious time. For fans of HOAX, FRIED EGG, long stretches of unemployment, etc. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Human Future Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Ignorantes Las Promesas Que Te Hacemos Te Las Puedes Meter Por El Cul 7\u2033 Chilean punks IGNORANTES usually deal in scorched, blown-out, hyper-abrasive recordings\u2014the kind of raw tupa-tupa punk that is so harsh it feels like it\u2019s stripping paint. But this two-song 7\u2033 is a bit of a curveball, serving up super lo-fi but almost poppy Oi! with plasticky keyboards that give it an odd sweetness. While digging through their catalog for this review, the release that grabbed me most was No Hemos Inventado Nada, Ni Nos Interesa Hacerlo , even though the recording quality is so brutal it made my ears bleed. By contrast, this 7\u2033 is lighter and bouncier. Side A\u2019s \u201cAdi\u00f3s Camarada\u201d even carries a hint of that CURE \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d tune, which gives the whole thing an oddly familiar flavor. I respect the swing into new territory, even if it doesn\u2019t fully land for me. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label General Speech Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Kolpeka / Revert split 12\u2033 Perfectly executed split 12\u201d showcasing two bands from the Basque Country, a region whose punk and Oi! scene Mendeku Diskak has pretty much put on the map. On the A-side is REVERT, whose tooth-chipping stompers take cues from early Boston hardcore. REVERT\u2019s vocals are particularly rough and pissed, taking these songs up a notch or two on the aggro-meter. KOLPEKA follows up on the B-side, and while they retain some of the East Coast brutishness of their fellow countrymen, they have a little more spring in their step. I\u2019ve read from a couple of sources that KOLPEKA are avid skateboarders, so maybe that explains the slight uptick in energy. Regardless of its source, their speediness compliments the more mid-tempo pace of REVERT nicely, making for a well-rounded split. Top it all off with the killer artwork this is wrapped in, and Mendeku Diskak once again proves why they\u2019re one of the best in the game. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Liquid Cross Don\u2019t Think cassette In reading the Bandcamp description for this release, three things feel undeniable\u2014the SAINTS, the WIPERS, and the Pacific Northwest. I might add RADIO BIRDMAN here as well to round out what the listener might expect. These songs have a palpable desperation to them that really draws the listener in and along. The image of a fresh smelling pine tree enshrouded in a dense fog makes sense here as well; you can sense the presence of melody, but you can\u2019t easily see it through the wonderful sonic din. These tracks are timeless DIY. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Strange Mono Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Making Friends as Adults New Road CD I\u2019m never sure what\u2019s going to happen when an acoustic guitar starts off a record, but dang, it\u2019s in and out fast. Pulling from BRAID, DISCOUNT, LEMURA, POHGOH, FIFTH HOUR HERO, and so on, these are catchy songs delivered in a thoughtful, melodic way that can bring early ALKALINE TRIO to mind. Although MAKING FRIENDS AS ADULTS pulls from these bands, they also are clearly carving their own path. There are eleven songs on here and I think they maybe could have gone with eight or nine, but overall, this CD is a great listen. One bit of advice for MAKING FRIENDS AS ADULTS would be to not do it. I\u2019m in my fifties, and at a certain point, you know enough people and making friends is overrated and tiresome. Reviewer Tony Party Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Mask Appeal Slice & Slice EP Debut release from Los Angeles-based MASK APPEAL. With members from DETROIT COBRAS, OOZELLES, and the STARLITE DESPERATION to name a few, this lot is well steeped in a noisy, industrial death wail akin to the BIRTHDAY PARTY. The bass is way up front in the mix, propelling this creature forward, with big, hall-reverb drums, and both set the stage for a writhing, shimmering guitar and howling vocals that inspire a morbid fascination. A tragic poem recited to an anxious pulse. Thank you to whatever forces of good and evil brought these three together, MASKED APPEAL truly rules. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Slouch Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Okres Demo \u201985 / Jarocin \u201985 LP Pulled from obscurity and into your stack of questionable records, this archival LP remembers OKRES out of Ostr\u00f3w Wielkopolski, Greater Poland. The first half of the album features the band\u2019s demo recordings from 1985, and the second portion brings us another blast from the past of the legendary Jarocin music festival of that same year. It\u2019s fast and loose first wave hardcore driven by pure energy\u2014\u201cLiban Nie \u017byje\u201d has a wicked swarming guitar attack like Government Issue\u2019s \u201cSheer Terror.\u201d There\u2019s nine crude tunes from the demo and nine from the festival, but Bandcamp only teases four songs, so if you want to hear the whole thing, you\u2019ll have to pony up. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Warsaw Pact Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Pages Ordinary Love / I\u2019m a Bullet 7\u2033 From Portugal, these guys remind me of the TRANZMITORS, if only because they bring a sound rooted in mod and power pop. The music is straightforward and mid-tempo. The vocals are soft and almost whispery at times, just sort of calming. The B-side is particularly catchy and a total toe-tapper/head-bouncer. This is definitely worth checking out. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Lux Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Rude Television I Want to Believe EP Another entry in the egg-punk universe: bouncy synths, wiry guitars, playful neon energy. RUDE TELEVISION executes it well, though the formula feels reused, with the record\u00b4s explosive highlight being \u201cArtificial Paint.\u201d A fun, energetic listen\u2014enjoyable, but not essential. Otro cap\u00edtulo del universo egg-punk: sintes saltarines, guitarras procesadas y ese pulso juguet\u00f3n que define el estilo. RUDE TELEVISION lo hace bien, aunque la f\u00f3rmula se siente reutilizada, siendo el punto \u00e1lgido del disco su track \u201cArtificial Paint.\u201d Un disco simp\u00e1tico, energ\u00e9tico y disfrutable, aunque no esencial. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Sweet Time Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Spares / Treasure Pains split 12\u2033 Alright, I\u2019ve griped about this before, so I wanna get it out of the way first\u2014please stop halving split albums between two different Bandcamp accounts. It defeats the purpose of said split! I know it\u2019s all together on the record, but the vast majority of people will be listening online. Keep it together, folks! SPARES play classic post-hardcore and remind me a bit of RUSSIAN CIRCLES (with vocals), and THRICE. TREASURE PAINS are in the same realm and have more of a dissonant edge like RIVAL SCHOOLS and HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. Production for both bands is crisp and loud as hell. Really solid stuff here. I\u2019d go as far as saying it\u2019s worth bouncing between two Bandcamps. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Council / Wiretap Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Speed Week Weak Speed 12\u2033 With players from the excellent Australian bands the BRAKES and SPLIT SYSTEM comes a snarling slab of punk with conviction. SPEED WEEK presents here with an assured confidence and maturity that perfectly tempers their wild-eyed energy. Reminiscent of more mainstream acts like SHAME or FONTAINES D.C. but with a wiry cool, this band sounds poised for bigger and better things without the fear of losing their edge. It\u2019s well-read, high-energy punk rock that doesn\u2019t miss a step. Impressive as so few new acts are. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Erste Theke Tontr\u00e4ger Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Subversive Intent Subversive Intent demo cassette A solid debut from San Diego\u2019s newest hardcore outfit SUBVERSIVE INTENT. Plenty of speed and leads on top of leads call to mind SoCal legends BATTALION OF SAINTS. Better than average production pushes this one past usual demo fare, making it more than worth a listen. Check out \u201cPayaso\u201d and \u201cWeathervane.\u201d Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Camel Clutch / Rebirth Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Sympathy Flowers Dreams of Lurking Fear LP Dreams of Lurking Fear is the first full-length by Oakland, CA dark punk band SYMPATHY FLOWERS. However, Dreams of Lurking Fear is an expansion of last year\u2019s Through the Veil cassette (which was SYMPATHY FLOWERS inaugural release), with most of the cassette tracks being reworked with a better density and richness for the LP. There\u2019s something in SYMPATHY FLOWERS\u2019 sound that reminds me of the below-the-radar punk that cemented my relationship to our illustrious genre in my teen years. Maybe it\u2019s the driving rhythms blended with the quick shift guitar riffs, or maybe it\u2019s the poetic-but-direct lyrics that are defiant while deviant. Whatever it is, Dreams of Lurking Fear scratches an itch I didn\u2019t even know I had. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Cellofame Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 TTTTurbo Modern Music cassette Someday people who write great pop songs won\u2019t be so scared of themselves, obscuring their catchiness with lo-fi tricks and budget ethos. But in the meantime, it\u2019s still lovely to spend time with a tape like this that sounds like California underwater with the good vibes still intact. The bouncy bass lines walking up and down the throbbing synths and half-muttered bedroom vocals can\u2019t hide forever that these are bangin\u2019 pop songs. I hear you, TTTTURBO, and I know what you\u2019re up to. You can throw an egg on top while you\u2019re at it. Sounds great like an artifact from the future. Reviewer Luke Henley Label It's Eleven Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Uzu \u00c0 Qui La Libert\u00e9? \u0644\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u061f LP Symphony of Destruction has quite the knack for bringing us bands that push the boundaries of punk. Case in point: UZU returns with their second full-length, building out their deathrock gloom ship for further exploration. Based in Montr\u00e9al, the group is an international outfit with ties to Algeria and Colombia, delivering their lyrics in Arabic. To the latter point, the vocal delivery is one of the elements that sets UZU apart, with an inflection falling somewhere between Jello Biafra and Rozz Williams. While CHRISTIAN DEATH is certainly a jumping-off point, UZU charts a path of their own, much like fellow Canucks HOME FRONT and ULTRA RAZZIA (with whom they share members) have. Inspiration is more a point of departure than an anchor. \u00c0 Qui La Libert\u00e9? is a bold, forceful album. Don\u2019t sleep on this one. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Symphony of Destruction Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Why Bother? Case Studies LP Prolific punks WHY BOTHER? are back with another LP on the heels of an EP released earlier this year. While the former relied heavily on a synthesized version of \u201980s-inspired Midwestern punk, Case Studies sees the band, yet again, charting fresh ground, but I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s such a good thing. Make no mistake, every few songs, there is a song that rips. They shine on tracks like \u201cI Take Back,\u201d \u201cThere She Was,\u201d or the album closer \u201cGalaxy Eyes,\u201d where they effortlessly combine heavy \u201970s psych melodies with SPITS-style lo-fi goodness, and vocals that call to mind early GUIDED BY VOICES. Unfortunately, the rest of the record felt boring and longwinded. Songs often drift in and out of ambient and instrumental explorations that would best be saved for a Friday jam session rather than on a recording. Repeated listens could change my mind, but I\u2019m not sure I have the attention span to reach for this one again. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Feel It Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Xray Xeroxx Social Media Made Me Hate My Friends cassette Short and sweet four-song cassette EP by an incredibly active Los Angeles-based solo project. This is the third cassette release by XRAY XEROXX (two EPs and a full-length), all of which came out this damn year! Juvenile, upbeat, poppy, garage-infused RAMONES-core filled with both self-deprecation and societal deprecation. There sure is a lot to hate in this world, but I do not hate XRAY XEROXX. Looking forward to the three releases this project is due to shit out throughout 2026. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Robot Cannibal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 1-800-Mikey / Gee Tee split EP Split release pairing Sydney\u2019s 1-800 MIKEY and GEE TEE. 1-800 MIKEY is a project from Michael Barker, who also plays in GEE TEE. His tracks are lo-fi, innocent, and achingly whimsical, similar to fellow Sydneysiders TEE VEE REPAIRMANN and Portland\u2019s CHEERY CHEEKS. GEE TEE has been referred to as the Australian SPITS, but on their track, they slow it down with a tune that sounds beautifully crafted like NOBUNNY covering DANIEL JOHNSTON in a bedroom on a four-track. Reviewer Tim Janchar Label Prison Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Alibi Alibi cassette Yet another contemporary German throwback to the Neue Deutsche Welle, and I\u2019m not mad about it. Opener \u201cIrgendwas Ist Immer\u201d builds plenty of tension and drama over three-and-a-half minutes, and there\u2019s a sharp, Zickzack\u2019d angularity cutting through in the staccato guitar stabs and rigid rhythms of \u201cAttit\u00fcde\u201d and \u201cZust\u00e4nde,\u201d but on a whole, Kiel\u2019s ALIBI are far less shrouded and goth-influenced than the Berlin-based contingent of modern XMAL DEUTSCHLAND disciples like AUS, DIE SCHIEFE BAHN, and MISERE, landing somewhere closer to the second HANS-A-PLAST LP that bridged their late \u201970s speedy punk spark with an expanded early \u201980s post-punk palette. Impressively tight and locked-in for what\u2019s essentially a first demo, and if whatever comes next plays up even more of the latent art-damage that I\u2019m picking up on here, it could be genuinely savage.

The personnel comes from jazz, more or less, but you can hear bits of ambient chill-out, early aughts EDM, hip hop, house and free improvisation. Slashing, bumping, \u201cTake Out the Trash\u201d runs on a noir-ish bassline, a bit of David Axelrod\u2019s cinematics or Death in Vegas\u2019 ominous dance grooves in its cowbell clanging, horn-bursting swagger. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Nicola Alesini & Pier Luigi Andreoni :: Marco Polo Nicola Alesini & Pier Luigi Andreoni\u2019s 1996 \u2018ambient-word record\u2019 Marco Polo . Vine-like, lush and minimal, layered and discreet, with assists from Japan\u2019s David Sylvian (vocals), Pierrot Lunaire\u2019s Arturo Stalteri (bouzouki, harmonium), Roger Eno (keyboards, percussion, vocals), David Torn (guitar), and Harold Budd (percussion). Fourth world, indeed. Read More Spotify Apple Music Close The Blue Nile :: Hats A mosaic of romance and sorrow, Hats evokes a liminal metropolis bathed in the  amber glow of sodium-vapor street lamps, where lonely souls wander down  moonlit alleyways in search of something that has already left them long  ago. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Sharp Pins :: Balloon Balloon Balloon Kai Slater dons the velvet flares once again for this superlative dose of psychedelic 1960s pop, spun out on electric 12-string and recorded in a dazey cloud of lo-fi fuzz. This is the second LP this year for Sharp Pins following this spring\u2019s Radio DDR , and Slater was also a big part of Lifeguards\u2019 post-punk Ripped and Torn, as well.Never mind. The youth of Chicago have a lot in the tank. There\u2019s not a bad song on the disc, and there are 21 of them in all. Impressive. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Talk Talk :: Spirit of Eden Some records feel impossible to write about. Not because they lack substance, but because they possess too much of it: too much quiet, too much space, too much mystery. They resist language the way water resists a net. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Big Bend :: Last Circle In A Slowdown The third album from pianist/singer Nathan Phillips\u2019 Big Bend project blends experimental methods with time-tested tradition. Working with avant-jazz master Shahzad Ismaily and a varied ensemble including Jen Powers of Rolin/Powers Duo and violinist Zosha Warpeha, Phillips transforms delicate folk songs into strange collages and elliptical ballads. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Sessa :: Pequena Vertigem de Amor Like many notable Brazilian musicians before him, Sessa straddles continents and cultures, having launched his career in the U.S., but calling S\u00e3o Paulo home (again). We recently up with Sessa to discuss the way Pequena Vertigem de Amor sounds different from his previous albums, from the instrumentation to the vocals and may be his best album yet. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Jon Hassell / Brian Eno :: Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics The music winds sinuously, like a river in deep, humid tropics. In six tracks which blend seamlessly into one musical entity, this pivotal collaboration from Brian Eno and Jon Hassell explores a mystical, minimalist music, tinted by Southern Hemisphere sounds but also incorporating 20th century electronics. The cuts move slowly but insistently, a sensuous wiggle in their syncopation. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Gene Ammons :: Nice an\u2019 Cool (1961) Posted on December 16, 2025 December 15, 2025 True to Moodsville\u2019s curation, Nice \u2018an Cool is nothing if not a \u201cmood album,\u201d the overall unity of the quartet eclipsing any one section of the arrangement. The band keeps dynamics to a gentle hush; Ammons plays his melody lines straight, keeping embellishments to a bare minimum. Still, the ear can\u2019t help but single out Ammons\u2019 tenor sax. His tone is unmistakable: deep, rich, and warm. He doesn\u2019t so much play notes as he breathes his soul into them, tinting each legato phrase with a lifetime\u2019s worth of dreams and regrets. A John Waters Christmas (2004) Posted on December 16, 2025 December 11, 2025 Christmas provides the perfect setting for Waters to juxtapose with his subversive authorship: taking something cheerful, domestic, and sentimental and gleefully deforming it into tawdry anarchy. So it should come as no surprise that when New Line Records asked the cult icon to compile a Christmas album, Waters curated a track listing far off the beaten path of Bing Crosby and Andy Williams. \u201cI think a few of these songs are awful,\u201d Waters would say. \u201cBut they\u2019re so awful, they\u2019re perfect.\u201d Eberhard Weber on ECM: Primary Colours Posted on December 15, 2025 December 11, 2025 ECM may exist without Eberhard Weber, but it wouldn\u2019t be ECM as we know it. From his 1973 debut through decades of collaboration, Weber\u2019s ECM catalog is difficult to absorb, with offshoots that aren\u2019t for every taste. Still, it\u2019s a body of work that rewards exploration. Here\u2019s one path among many. The Blue Nile :: Hats Posted on December 11, 2025 December 11, 2025 The Blue Nile\u2019s Hats is filled with lovesick people and nocturnal places, existing in a perpetual state of starless nights and slanted rainfall. The album evokes a liminal metropolis bathed in the amber glow of sodium-vapor street lamps, where lonely souls wander down moonlit alleyways in search of something that has already left them long ago. It is here, where traffic lights blink for no one and smoke curls around sewer lids, that Hats stakes its home. It sustains this atmosphere from beginning to end \u2014 each song a jigsaw puzzle piece that forms a mosaic of romance and sorrow. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on December 10, 2025 December 9, 2025 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Transmissions :: Mike Ayers ( The Untold Story of the \u201990s Jam Bands) Posted on December 10, 2025 December 9, 2025 The \u201990s were a strange time. From Gregorian chants to swing bands, you never knew what would make it onto the radio. But some of the strangest groups to improbably infiltrate the mainstream came from the post-Grateful Dead jam band scene. Our guest today is Mike Ayers, author of \u2060 Sharing in the Groove: The Untold Story of the \u201990s Jam Band Explosion and the Scene that Followed. Aquarium Drunkard :: Year In Review 2025 Posted on December 8, 2025 December 11, 2025 Looking back to look ahead. The clock never stops, but sometimes music manages the impossible: slowing time for a moment. Our list arrives in the spirit of sharing, and we\u2019re back with our annual Year In Review. As always the following is unranked and unruly. Let it blurb. World Standard :: Human Circle of Memory Posted on December 5, 2025 December 4, 2025 While this year marked the fortieth anniversary of the avant-pop debut World Standard, musician Soichiro Suzuki returns with a brand new record Komorevia under the long-running moniker. Lead single \u201cHuman Circle of Memory\u201d is a carefully crafted work invoking the spirit of the last four decades of the singular World Standard universe, with fading reverberations and echoes of chiming bells and woodwinds overlapping with layered synthesizers (and soft vocals from Yoriko Matsumoto). A self-described sunlight filtering through the trees, indeed. Milton Nascimento :: Maria Maria (1976) Posted on December 4, 2025 December 3, 2025 While Milton Nascimento is more known internationally for his role in Brazilian jazz fusion, he also composed landmark MPB records of his own, that often brought forth folkloric Brazilians genres like toada , lundu , moda de viola , and even some Medieval revivalism. Maria Maria is a highlight among those explosions of ancestral rhythms. Composed as the soundtrack to a 1976 ballet about a black female slave choreographed by Group Corpo, it would eventually culminate in the historic Missa dos Quilombos in 1982, when Milton led a drum-filled Catholic mass for a legion of Afro-Brazilians in the Pra\u00e7a do Carmo, Recife . . . The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on December 3, 2025 December 2, 2025 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Yo La Tengo :: Electr-O-Pura at 30 Posted on December 3, 2025 December 3, 2025 1995 was an inflection point for so many of indie rock\u2019s finest. But in the story Yo La Tengo, Electr-O-Pura doesn\u2019t invite lofty historicizing. Sandwiched between two of their most important records, it feels like business as usual\u2014and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so good. 30 years on, we can see how we were lucky enough to be invited inside their little world of inside jokes and off-kilter psychedelic jamming. Transmissions :: Steve Wynn (The Dream Syndicate) Posted on December 3, 2025 December 3, 2025 This week on the show, a return guest: Steve Wynn of The Dream Syndicate and solo fame. He last joined the show part of a trio: in 2018, we taped with him, Howe Gelb of Giant Sand, and Robyn Hitchcock live at the KXCI studio at Hotel Congress in Tucson Arizona. That talk also made it into the Transmissions feed again in 2021. Flea :: A Plea Posted on December 2, 2025 December 1, 2025 \u201cI\u2019m not being corny/this shit\u2019s for real,\u201d Flea intones over a bubbling jazz fusion groove on \u201cA Plea,\u201d a new solo single which finds the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist returning to his first instrument: the trumpet. Backed by a cadre of the West Coast\u2019s most innovative and hip jazz players, this a musical rebirth for the Funky Monk.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
