Electronic / Experimental PLAGUE MUSIC EP KAVARI A noise artist who once found hidden music in the crackle of fire sounds equally incendiary on her latest EP of club music, sculpting redlining rhythms out of blocks of charred bass. Experimental Rosacea Gaute Granli The Norwegian artist\u2019s loop-based assemblages follow a strange, dreamlike logic, weaving indecipherable vocals and stray bits of texture into warped avant-pop.

AllMusic Staff Picks AllMusic Staff Pick \u2013 February 7, 2026 Tori Amos Boys for Pele January 23, 1996 Adult Alternative Pop/Rock Thirty years ago, Tori Amos went three-for-three (in terms of classic albums) with the release of the raw and visceral Boys for Pele. Haunting in its beauty and harsh in its rage, it was a divisive change upon release, as she made a jarring shift in approach to its coming-of-age predecessors. Three decades later, it's arguably her most powerful and complicated opus, one that not only set the stage for the longer concept albums and storytelling yet to come, but that revealed messier emotions and new avenues for healing. Little Earthquakes may be the classic, but this is where the real ones come for the good stuff. - Neil Z.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37429 Reviews Axis Mundi TarLing The title means \u201crepresenting a symbolic, vertical axis connecting heaven, earth, and the underworld. It acts as a sacred, central pillar or portal.\u201d Themes mentioned in their bio match the music quite well. The music is slow, filthy sounding, and apocalyptic in some senses\u2026and reminds you that the world is actually a fucked place. John Carpenter (Redux) Besta I like my songs to last longer than a couple seconds, but if those couple seconds are good, then I'm all ready for\u00a0Besta. Misty Woman Aunt Cynthia's Cabin Aunt Cynthia\u2019s Cabin were originally a duo formed in 2018 in San Diego,USA by Brennan [\u2026] American Rebel Powerhouse Powerhouse\u2019s\u00a0 highly anticipated sophomore album \u201cAmerican Rebel\u201d, is an explosive 6 track ride of pure [\u2026] Quan tot s'apagui Syberia I have always maintained that instrumental music is harder to write and listen to, because vocals and lyrics aren\u2019t here to guide your way. SYBERIA are masters at creating landscapes that you have never seen before\u2026never experienced before. It\u2019s like a trip through every corner of the universe with your eyes closed and only your imagination guides the way. T\u00e9km\u00e9s Juodvarnis This was a fantastic release, and I don\u2019t believe I have ever heard a band from Lithuania before. The secret to their sound was combining aggressiveness and torture with atmosphere, ambiance, and melody. There were just enough Progressive elements (odd chord progressions, technical prowess, etc.) to keep the sound modern and interesting, and I would love to hear what the band does next. Zombie Chronicles Vol. 1 Season of the Dead Booriingg Many Will Never Know This Freedom Skyclad Cult This EP is so endearing. Reliance Soen SOEN shows no signs of slowing down on \u201cReliance.\u201d The songs are a bit more concise in terms of their length, but it\u2019s the emotional impact that will sweep you off your feet. Primordial What Will Be I have to say that even though this isn\u2019t even close to my cup of tea, there is no denying that WHAT WILL BE exists of four very good musicians who really gel well together. They know how to complement each other in such a way that it makes the songs sound very good indeed. Decomposition Pythonic PYTHONIC does command respect. The way they have approached the music is impressive. I hear Metalcore, I get Metal Hardcore, I receive Groove metal and I hear Heavy Metal. Sometimes one of the four, at other times two or more of the four ingredients on offer. And what is even more impressive; they work well together. Inner Keep Mother Crone There is no way in Heaven or Hell that I can\u2019t NOT like what MOTHER CRONE is offering me on \u201cInner Keep\u201d, as the songs are all of a very high standard, have all the right ingredients to sound amazing. Proper introductions, solid foundations, hard edged bodies and fitting endings. Guerre Et Paix Via Doloris Overall, this was a good album. It wasn\u2019t too aggressive or dark, and you could also clearly hear some nice bass work. I also found it to be as advertised\u2026leading melodies with Folk echoes, and they did show restraint in the album. Obsidian Cult Hollow Peak Norse heavy metal band\u00a0Hollow Peak\u00a0released their debut LP\u00a0Obsidian Cult\u00a0on January 23, 2026. This album impressed [\u2026] Thou Hast Done Nothing Nornes French doom/death metal band\u00a0Nornes\u00a0released their newest album\u00a0Thou Hast Done Nothing\u00a0on December 2, 2025. It's an [\u2026] Planned Obsolescence Only Human This was an outstanding Progressive album, and in many ways, it might point towards where the genre is headed for the future. The band has some serious chops, but they don\u2019t overtake the sound, which is heavily focused on an emotional impact. It kept moving forward\u2026branching out, exploring, uncovering rocks that used to be a permanent part of the scene, and each transition was completely smooth. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Same Drug New High Gluecifer I don\u2019t care what your status is emotionally, if \u201cSame Drug New High\u201d doesn\u2019t make you feel better than I haven\u2019t got a clue what will. I know that every time I listen to this GLUECIFER album I get a big smile on my face, start tapping my foot and nodding my head. Welcome back!! Apocalypse Inc Frozen Factory The eclectic mix of styles and musical directions actually works on \u201cApocalypse Inc\u201d, the fourth album by FROZEN FACTORY. Somehow, they have adopted the ability to make all the different angles come together in a way that the blending is almost unnoticeable, but still very much present when you really take a listen.

The concept behind their debut album, \u201cCzarty Polskie,\u201d has been controversial not only for the AI debate but for the many references to Polish demonology. On All Hallows Eve, Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with members of CZART to discuss everything from AI to the reasons why metal resonates so much in Poland to whether we are living in the best of times or the worst. Most importantly, they discuss the beloved CZART goat. Sam Graff Agenbite Misery AGENBITE MISERY hails from New Hampshire.

On September 26, 2025 they released their third full-length album, \u201cUpon Tall Thrones,\u201d which not only weighed in at 8/10 on the Metal Temple scales but hit #1 on Doom Charts for September 2025. This month Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, was able to catch up with Stefano Fiorelli (guitars, vocals) to discuss the origin story of WARCOE, details of their latest album, and even speculate on the impacts of AI and streaming platforms. Jacob Curwen All Hell All Hell has been described as a Blackened Thrash band, but they are much more. On October 10, 2025, the trio for Ashville, North Carolina release their fifth full-length album, \"Sunsetter,\" via Terminus Hate City. Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with Jacob Curwen (vocals, guitars) to discuss topics ranging from the band's origins to the details of \"Sunsetter\" to AI in metal.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Bitterness \u2013 Hallowed Be the Game Review By Tyme on February 6, 2026 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 8 comments \u201cThrash metal trio Bitterness has been riffing around Germany\u2019s underground metal scene since 2002. And despite a twenty-plus-year career spent in a state of sustained anonymity, these thrashers three are ready to throw down their eighth full-length odyssey, Hallowed Be the Game . Marching under the thrash banner in a country that birthed not only the Big Teutonic 4, but some very endearing second-tier bands,  takes guts and persistence. Luckily, Bitterness has a little bit of both.\u201d In the game of German thrash, be bitter or be dead. Moon Mother \u2013 Meadowlands Review By Grymm on February 6, 2026 in Reviews , Not Metal , 23 comments \u201cI grew up with a slew of friends who dabbled in the visual arts throughout the years. One in particular blew me away by stating that the greatest artists aren\u2019t the masters of their trade in every aspect, but rather they know what they don\u2019t have, or rather don\u2019t need, to make a sizable impact. You don\u2019t need to own the most expensive paint set, a wide array of colors at your disposal, or to fill up the canvas with stuff. You have to just create your vision with what you have, and let the negative space do the work for you. Swedish duo Moon Mother knows this. On their second full-length, Meadowlands , they paint a lush, aural landscape teeming with anguish, grief, and trauma, while also crafting a sense of wonder, peace, and a smidge of hope.\u201d Marsh but fair. Tailgunner \u2013 Midnight Blitz Review By Steel Druhm on February 6, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , 62 comments \u201cAfter staggering off four crazy days at sea for the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise, my ears and brain are fried unto merciless death. Luckily, I anticipated this contingency and left myself a fairly easy bounce-back to reality with the sophomore album from England\u2019s classic metal rockers, Tailgunner .\u201d Shooting for and at the sky. Dyed in Grey \u2013 Harbinger Review By ClarkKent on February 5, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Progressive Metal , 21 comments \u201cFor progressive death metal acts, the shadow of the masters, Opeth looms large. Yet some recent progressive death acts, like Iotunn , T\u00c3\u00b3mar\u00c3\u00bam , and Dvne , have carved their own paths in the genre. When Dyed in Grey released their debut, The Abandoned Part , in 2013, Opeth was charting a course into pure prog sans death metal. I only mention Opeth because Dyed in Grey \u2019s brand of prog death sees clear influences in the titans of the genre, though with a more technical, improvisational imprint.\u201d Grey and fancy. Agenbite Misery \u2013 Remorse of Conscience Review By Andy-War-Hall on February 5, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Noise Rock , Post-Metal , Sludge Metal , 57 comments \u201cAnyone who\u2019s brushed against James Joyce\u2019s modernist classic Ulysses has almost certainly encountered the phrase \u201cremorse of conscience\u201d before. A pivotal theme of the novel, remorse of conscience refers to more than mere guilt over a perceived ethical failure but the misery inflicted by it, its weight and torment. In the days leading up to receiving Remorse of Conscience , the independent debut from New Hampshire\u2019s genre-blending Agenbite Misery , a record informed by Ulysses and \u201csteeped in grief, alienation and the search for meaning in modern life,\u201d I was experiencing that eponymous turmoil myself.\u201d Modern Hellenic disorientation. Tarlung \u2013 Axis Mundi Review By Tyme on February 5, 2026 in Reviews , Doom Metal , Sludge Metal , 22 comments \u201cVienna, Austria\u2019s Tarlung has been coughing up thick clouds of resinous doom and smoky sludge since 2013, when, after just six months in existence and having never performed live, they released their eponymous debut album. Now, with two additional full-lengths\u00e2\u0080\u00942017\u2019s Beyond the Black Pyramid and 2021\u2019s Architect \u00e2\u0080\u0094and some healthy touring under their belts, Tarlung braces to bring their fourth album in nearly five years, Axis Mundi , to the masses.\u201d Coughing up the goods. Course of Fate \u2013 Behind the Eclipse Review By Twelve on February 4, 2026 in Reviews , Progressive Metal , 19 comments \u201cAfter waiting seventeen years to release their debut full-length, Norwegian progressive metal act Course of Fate is now three albums in since 2020. I missed their sophomore release in 2023\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u2019m actually just learning it exists as I type this\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I was especially excited to see this group back in action. Mindweaver was a delight of an album, the kind of release that hums with potential and makes you eager to see what a band is going to do next.\u201d Progressive futures. Mayhem \u2013 Liturgy of Death Review By Grin Reaper on February 4, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 99 comments \u201c Mayhem \u2019s reputation will forever be linked to their early days, inescapably tethered to the chaos of death. While it\u2019s impossible not to acknowledge those grisly events when considering the band\u2019s legacy, they detract from the unyielding musical vision Mayhem has etched into metal mythology. From the beginning, Mayhem has been at the forefront as one of black metal\u2019s tastemakers and breath-takers. Over four decades in, Mayhem returns with Liturgy of Death \u00e2\u0080\u0094a fitting subject considering the band\u2019s sordid origins and their penchant for metaphysical musings.\u201d Never ending mayheming. Diespnea \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Radici Review By Kronos on February 4, 2026 in Avante Garde , Black Metal , Code666 Records , Italian Metal , Releases , Reviews , Black Metal , 35 comments \u201cA black metal album bent on re-orienting the genre away from a frostbitten North and towards an imaginary sun-bleached South, the saguaro being perhaps the most resilient (and, tellingly, clich\u00c3\u00a9d) symbol thereof. Ambitions often crumble against this landscape; the schemes of miners fall through, the hopeful homesteads dry into rubble, at the bodies of desperate migrants collapse in the canyons. Beauty and hostility, available in such great measure here, produce the romance of the desert, the basis for Radici .\u201d Like a cactus in the snow. Lord of the Lost \u2013 Opvs Noir Vol 2 Review By ClarkKent on February 3, 2026 in Reviews , Gothic Metal , Industrial Metal , Pop Metal , Symphonic Metal , 23 comments \u201cLittle did I realize when Napalm announced that Lord of the Lost was recording a 33-song trilogy that each album would release so close to one another. A mere four months following the release of Opvs Noir Vol 1 , we get Opvs Noir Vol 2 , and it\u2019s just in time for stocking stuffer season. Vol 1 was my introduction to this one-time Eurovision finalist, and I came away impressed. So I was pretty excited to see this in the doldrums of our December promo bin. With the quick release of Vol 2 , I can only assume Lord of the Lost wrote all 33 songs of the trilogy together, Lord of the Rings -style.\u201d Lots of lost.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Destroyer :: Destroyer's Rubies Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together In 1976 the granola jazzists teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in the sphere, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Cat Power :: What Would the Community Think at 30 Posted on February 6, 2026 February 6, 2026 By 1996, Chan Marshall had already recorded two lo-fi albums\u2014 Dear Sir and Myra Lee \u2014with Steve Shelley and Tim Foljan and moved from her native south to New York City. She had just turned 24 when she holed up at Easley Studios in Memphis to record album number three with the same team, her first time recording in a professional space. And while 1998\u2019s Mood Pix would serve as her breakout, this Matador debut captures the wild, raw, unfiltered power of Marshall\u2019s art, an unpredictable electricity that runs through the songs, buzzing and fizzing and threatening explosion at any time. Wilder Maker :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on February 6, 2026 February 6, 2026 Songwriter Gabriel Birnbaum\u2019s latest with Wilder Maker, 2025\u2019s The Streets Like Beds Still Warm , leans into sophisto-pop shaded indie pop noir, careening from rootsy swagger into bursts of digital space jazz and ambient funk. Birnbaum narrates like a streetwise-type who\u2019s been up way too long, finding warped and engaging hooks around every corner. He joins us to discuss. Videodrome :: Safe (1995) Posted on February 5, 2026 February 5, 2026 Safe has been called a psychological drama, a social satire, an allegory of the 1980s AIDS crisis, and a meditation on American culture in a post-industrial landscape. More than thirty years after its release, the film\u2019s peculiar themes remain open to interpretation, continuing to invite discussion and debate. Silvia Tarozzi :: Lucciole Posted on February 5, 2026 February 4, 2026 Lucciole , the latest album from Italian violinist, composer, vocalist, and improviser Silvia Tarozzi, unfolds like a strange existential drama. A richly layered work in every sense\u2014sonically, compositionally, thematically\u2014it seemingly traces the arc of a life in surrealist form while blending chamber folk, classical, and avant-garde sounds. Tarozzi immerses her voice in an environment of strings, horns, guitars, keys, theremin, zither, and sound manipulation, creating something that feels breathtaking alive \u2014 the music is radiant, luminous like its namesake. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on February 4, 2026 February 3, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Doopees :: Doopee Time Posted on February 4, 2026 February 4, 2026 An oddity on just about every front, 1995\u2019s Doopee Time is a fictional universe crafted by Japanese composer and steelpan drum maestro Yann Tomita. From the depths of Tomita\u2019s Audio Science Laboratory, the narrative-based concept album (featuring vocals and spoken vignettes by Buffalo Daughter\u2019s Yumiko Ohno) straddles a retro-futuristic line of sparkling art pop originals and innovative, genre-bending covers from the likes of The Ronettes to Pet Sounds closer \u201cCaroline, No\u201d. Touching on that Spector production, musique concr\u00e8te, cosmic jazz and a healthy dose of John Cage composition, Yann Tomita\u2019s conceptual vision of the fictitious Doopees is one not to be missed (even stretched out over seventy three minutes). Bandcamping :: Winter 2026 Posted on February 4, 2026 February 3, 2026 With the latest Bandcamp Friday hitting on Feb. 6, the time is right to melt the ice of winter 2026 with some fresh and far out sounds. Discover some recent/recommended tunes below. Shintaro Noguchi & The Roadhouse Band. Nailah Hunter & Alia. Zander Raymond. Hans Chew, Old Saw. Jessica Williams. Jake Xerxes Fussell & James Elkington. The Far Sound. Malombo. Joe Harvey-Whyte & Paul Cousins. Muriel Grossmann :: Plays the Music of McCoy Tyner and the Grateful Dead Posted on February 3, 2026 February 3, 2026 On a four-track double album, Austrian saxophonist Muriel Grossmann pays tribute to the music of two American visionaries: McCoy Tyner and Bob Weir. Though the music of the jazz pianist and Grateful Dead guitarist would not seem to have much in common, Grossmann\u2019s festive, idiosyncratic renditions suggest some intriguing links. With an ear for robust melody and an open-ended approach, Grossmann has created a moving tribute that suggests the only true way to carry on is to transform. Have You Heard About the World Coming to an End? Posted on February 3, 2026 February 2, 2026 Released just before Christmas by London\u2019s Death is Not the End label, Have You Heard About the World Coming to an End? is a most welcome compilation of gospel choirs and harmony groups recorded between the late 1920s and mid 1950s. It\u2019s marvelous stuff\u2014raw and scruffy and spirited and cool. The Clean :: Mister Pop Posted on February 2, 2026 February 2, 2026 While consistency was always a calling card for legendary New Zealand band The Clean, their final record Mister Pop deserves a spot in the pantheon of all-time excellent swan song records. While never feeling a departure from the band\u2019s signature guitar pop sound, the record plays out like a swirling homage to the titan influences of the past: from the pure jangly nod to Rubber Soul and Ray Davies playbook to Velvets guitar drones and a pure krautrock experiment. On the eve of a recently announced definitive book on the band and following the tragic passing of the late Hamish Kilgour, the now seventeen-year old record provides a deeply fascinating revisit. Adam Bhala Lough on Deepfaking Sam Altman Posted on February 2, 2026 February 2, 2026 Adam Bhala Lough has made films about capricious characters. See his 2008 film The Upsetter: The Life & Music of \u201cLee\u201d Scratch Perry , or his 2009 film about Lil Wayne, The Carter , or his 2023 HBO series Telemarketers , about the underbelly of the telemarketing industry. But his new film, Deepfaking Sam Altman , is his most experimental and unusual project yet. Aquarium Drunkard caught up with Bhala Lough to discuss the movie, AI\u2019s potential and drawbacks, and why at the end of the day, we replace our humanity with efficient machinery at our own peril. Big Sky Documentary Film Festival 2026 Posted on January 29, 2026 January 29, 2026 We are heading to Missoula, MT next month. Excited to announce\u00a0that Aquarium Drunkard has curated the music portion of the 2026 Big Sky Documentary Film Festival happening\u00a0between February 13-22.\u00a0Seven music docs, new and vintage. Justin will be on site first weekend. Featuring:\u00a0Sun Ra: Do the Impossible.\u00a0Speed Racer: Welcome to the World of Vic Chesnutt. Little Feat: The\u00a0Documentary. Summer Tour.

Less than a year after the release of their full-length Under the Eternal Shadow (premiered and reviewed here at NCS ), London\u2019s Final Dose is back with a new EP, Endless Woe . Under the Eternal Shadow made it on my year-end list for 2025, so this latest release deserves some attention. Most press refers to Final Dose as hardcore-influenced black metal. While that\u2019s not necessarily wrong, it definitely minimizes what the group actually does. Certainly, they deliver the visceral assault such a descriptor implies. Opener \u201cGolden Chalice\u201d blends d-beats and punk moments with savage black metal, but Final Dose manages to maintain the atmosphere of black metal as well. The opening guitar figure evokes all the frost-bitten phantoms one can hope for, and then they segue into icy blasts. But just under two minutes in, a riff enters that splits the difference between Darkthrone and Minor Threat . It all works, whether one is meditating by candlelight or dancing in a pit; these guys have the magick.

We published an enlightening interview with bassist Lord Ashler and had the pleasure of making video premieres for two songs off the album in advance of its release. Today, with equal pleasure, we\u2019re premiering a third video from the band, this one for the song \u201c The Abysswalker \u201c. The video, directed by bandmember Javi Iron , is quite a spectacle, interweaving fast-cutting and eventually rain-drenched footage of these raging heathens throwing themselves headlong into the song\u2019s performance, along with striking imagery of an armored figure, presumably the Abysswalker of the song\u2019s title. The music is quite a spectacle too.

No matter what some would say, the late \u201990s and early \u201900s were when both the black and death metal scenes collided, with various results. In Sweden, despite Jon N\u00f6dtveidt landing in jail from 1997 onwards, you could still feel the aftermath of Dissection\u2019s gigantic Storm Of The Light\u2019s Bane and how it redefined a whole scene. If on the old continent No Fashion Records picked up the baton and ran with it, so did Necropolis Records on the other side of the Atlantic. By the time the next millennium was just around the corner, the Californian imprint seemed to mostly put out one future Swedish black/death metal classic after the other: Dawn\u2019s Slaughtersun , Arckanum\u2019s first three albums, Ophthalamia , Nifelheim , etc. Originally called Behemoth, In Aeternum showcased on Forvever Blasphemy , their debut for the label back in 1999, everything fans of that particular genre could hope for with a massive Fredman production, some ripping Necrolord cover artwork, and songs about the end of the world and the reaper. Even if things went a bit south in between the two parties after the release of their equally great second album The Pestilent Plague , those Swedes nevertheless did carry the torch all the way \u2018til the end of the \u201900s when they seemingly vanished off the face of the Earth. After a first attempted yet short-lived reunion in 2016, the band are finally back with a vengeance thanks to \u2026Of Death And Fire , their fifth full-length and first proper material in over a decade. We caught up with founding member David \u201cImpious\u201d Larsson to see if his inner flame still burns bright or not.

Reminder for self at end of year when going backwards for year-end purposes: This is a review for a 2025 release. I find myself musing on this constantly , if not just because it serves as a suitable cattle-prod to the brain to lure me from my \u201ccatch up on a whole year\u2019s worth of sleep in two-weeks\u201d stupor that the post-holiday season seems to have lulled me into. It is interesting that the first few releases of the year always find themselves entangled with a demented form of catch-up from the previous year. Time being the non-infinite resource from a mortal standpoint, it has not allowed us to cover the myriad things we wish to write about. There will always be one more, one late discovery, and often we invent excuses to continue looking backwards because a signal cast off into space still exists in some form of radio wave. We quest to find it and ackowledge it, and so the tail end of one year hangs on like the most stubborn bastard out there, refusing to let us continue forward into the next series of unending car-crashes that we adoringly refer to as our favored musical genre. We also, as a result, have compulsions and imagined debts that must be repaid and a mused-over line in a year-end list quickly becomes a one-way directive of something owed, whether a band is aware of it or not. Thus, it was promised that we would dive into Black Rabbit\u2019s December-released EP Warren Of Necrosis and goddamnit here we are, only two months later \u2013 as opposed to say five or ten as our previous records have been \u2013 looking at the continuation of the death and thrash metal act\u2019s conceptual universe, the follower EP to May 2025\u2019s Chronolysis .

First, it\u2019s a one-person project from my hometown of Austin, Texas (the person goes by Vileinist , a clever name for reasons you\u2019ll soon learn). Second, the title of the album is Tesuque , named for a place near Santa Fe in New Mexico that I and family members have visited frequently. And, well, the third reason for getting interested is that Vileinist is a violinist, and uses an electric violin to replace traditional guitar parts throughout the album. The occasion for first paying attention to Ferndom at our site was its release of the first single from Tesuque , a completely captivating song called \u201c Cacophony of Ice \u201c. We\u2019re paying more attention today because we\u2019re premiering a video for the album\u2019s second single, \u201c Stone-Toothed Abyss \u201c.

Its musical output has been prolific: Frozen Ocean has released 11 albums and a variety of shorter works since 2005. Yet there\u2019s been a significant interval between full-lengths since 2015\u2019s Prills of Remembrance . Now a new Frozen Ocean album named Askdr\u00f6mmar is finally on the way, with a release date of February 13th set by the Apocalyptic Witchcraft label. In its previous releases Frozen Ocean has thematically explored a wide range of subjects and inspirations. The new album draws inspiration from the writing of John Ajvide Lindqvist and the music of Lifelover , with lyrics written entirely in Swedish. Its themes are described on behalf of the label this way: Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 7:56 am Tagged with: Frozen Ocean THINGS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED (BUT SHOULDN\u2019T) Album Reviews 1 Response \u00bb Feb 05 2026 ( Andy Synn offers up 4 more albums from last month which you may have overlooked) As I may have mentioned in yesterday\u2019s article , it feels like I missed more than the usual number of albums in January\u2026 and while I know that it\u2019s impossible for anyone to properly listen to, let alone review , everything that comes out each month (despite some hyperbolic claims to the contrary by certain online clout-chasers) this has still bothered me quite a bit. After all, we\u2019re only a month into the year and we\u2019ve already managed to overlook the likes of Blackwater Holylight and P\u00e2ro , Ultima and Stabbing , Dagger Threat , Gavran and Juodvarnis (the latter two possibly being lined up for a future edition of The Synn Report each)\u2026 and countless others I\u2019ve probably forgotten about already. At the very least, however, the four vibrant and varied and (in their own way) visceral artists and albums I\u2019ve selected to talk about today should keep you all busy while I work out what I\u2019m going to write about this month!

That tale, which began to unfold in the band\u2019s 2021 debut album Fly the Fiendish Skies , envisioned a group of wealthy passengers fleeing the pandemic in a private jet ( like that ever happened! ), only to crash, descend into cannibalism, and trigger a zombie outbreak. The narrative was so tailor-made for the manifold awfulness of the covid pandemic that it wouldn\u2019t have been surprising if Heir Corpse One had been a \u201cone and done\u201d project. But no, these people obviously had so much fun making that first album that they forged on, not just with the music but with the gruesome concept story. And so now we\u2019re on the verge of getting the second Heir Corpse One album, Destination: Domination . And by \u201cverge\u201d, we mean the brink of February 6th , which is when Emanzipation Productions will disgorge the record. As you\u2019re about to discover first-hand, it\u2019s a ghastly delight.

It is not surprising that metal, one of the shining lights of postmodern art, that paragon of human creativity, has made a foothold in many different places around the world, and is luckily not limited anymore geographically or in any other way. Hailing from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, Stranguliatorius is another one of those worthy entries in our everlasting, world-encompassing quest for all things filthy and deadly. No strangers on these pages, we have been visited by these death dealers before. One of their previous albums got plenty of love here back in 2018, and deservedly so, with our editor calling the band \u201cdamned clever songwriters,\u201d managing to concoct \u201ca toxic brew of old school death metal, grindcore, doom, and d-beat crust\u201d. Sounds good to me. Now, I\u2019ve been to Vilnius some years back and it really is a nice place, but there\u2019s obviously something in the water, as they say, judging by the savage intensity on display. While some death metal bands have that distinctive stench arising from the decaying, rotten flesh with the imagery and riffs that go with it, some acquire a different perspective and put themselves in the role of the cold-blooded, flesh-cutting pathologist himself. Sister, pass the scalpel, please.

Doom on\u2026.) Silent hooded sinister figures in line disappearing into the mist next to a cenotaph as cover artwork, a nearly 25-minute opening track titled \u201cTo Rest Eternally\u201d\u2026 Even before pressing play, you more or less know that you\u2019re treading here on funeral doom territories, and that\u2019s somehow exactly what Lone Wanderer proudly deliver with Exequiae , their third album. But what\u2019s interesting with those Germans is that besides their unusual background \u2013 three out of four members also played pure classic \u201980s heavy-metal with Kerrigan \u2013 and the fact this is being released on High Roller Records, a well-established label and mail-order whose well-deserved reputation was built on high-quality classic metal vinyl reissues \u2014 they\u2019ve managed to somehow tweak their genre\u2019s otherwise firmly established assets into something quite personal, albeit still pretty much in debt to Mournful Congregation, whose mastermind Damon Good actually mixed their first two records. The band collectively agreed to lift the veil on their funeral obsessions\u2026 Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 6:56 am Tagged with: Lone Wanderer , Zoltar Older Entries Search No Clean
