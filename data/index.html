        <ul class="review">
            <li><b>Scritti Politti - Cupid & Psyche 85</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Though pop, the description 'deconstructed pop music' and 'clever' suggests significant artistic and intellectual merit, potentially offering inspiration for musical ideas despite the genre.</i></span></li><li><b>Black Magic Tree - Terra</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The album is noted for being a 'beautiful melting pot' of diverse rock influences from throughout the decades, hinting at artistic blend and merit.</i></span></li><li><b>Scythe - Boiled Alive</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The terms 'scuzzy shenanigans' and 'grimy panache' suggest a raw, unpolished, and characterful sound, which aligns with your aversion to highly processed music and your appreciation for artistic merit beyond mere technicality. Death Metal is also a preferred genre. While not explicitly 'innovative,' the unique description hints at artistic value.</i></span></li><li><b>Chroma Noir - Black Rain</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The blend of 'noir synth-pop' and 'darkwave mood meets pop momentum' has potential, reminiscent of The Cure (a favorite artist). While 'slick' could imply over-processing, the 'darkwave' and 'new wave' elements suggest artistic depth and a specific aesthetic that could appeal.</i></span></li><li><b>George Collins - What Living Is For</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: 'Americana rocker' with 'classic rock grit and soulful hooks' is a strong genre match. The artist's backstory of swapping a finance career for music suggests authentic artistic pursuit. While 'fist-in-the-air' is somewhat generic, the overall description points to solid artistic value within preferred genres.</i></span></li><li><b>Ibrahim Khalil Shihab Quintet - Spring</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 76]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Calls to mind 'Atlantic-era Coltrane,' and brings a 'masterfully moody vibe' with an 'homage to Trane’s 'Spiritual'.' This indicates artistic depth, emotional content, and a potentially heavier/moodier take on spiritual jazz.</i></span></li><li><b>Belle and Sebastian - If You’re Feeling Sinister</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: While indie-pop, the description 'deceptively complex set of character studies overflowing with compassion, humor' indicates artistic depth and lyrical merit that might offer inspiration, warranting a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Eddy Current Suppression Ring - Shapes and Forms</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The review describes the music as 'lo-fi garage rock', which aligns with your preference for less processed sounds and alternative rock genres. While not explicitly using terms of innovation, the description of the release as a 'genuine event' suggests artistic significance for the band's fanbase.</i></span></li><li><b>Kelan Phil Cohran - African Skies</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as being rooted in 'seminal works with Sun Ra' and 'tonally and spiritually,' offering a 'multisensory, Afrocentric journey.' This suggests high artistic merit and an experimental approach within the jazz genre, appealing to the desire for inspiration.</i></span></li><li><b>Deptford Sound Collective - Give Me. Give Me. Give Me, I want it all</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: While described as 'disco-fuelled,' the indication that it's a 'parody that looks shiny on the surface but bites hard' suggests artistic commentary and depth, aligning with the user's appreciation for artistic value and music that isn't just functional. The 'loose-knit crew of musicians, artists, and community activists' also hints at a more authentic, less processed approach.</i></span></li><li><b>Tobias from Emerald Park - A Song To C</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The origin story as an 'intimate gesture, written... for his wife' and its blooming into 'something far bigger' suggests genuine emotional depth and artistic sincerity, aligning with the user's qualitative criteria.</i></span></li><li><b>Fripp & Eno - Evening Star</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 72]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: A pioneering ambient work from influential artists, cited as echoing through the ambient genre. While ambient, it has historical artistic significance and could provide inspiration, similar to the appreciation for Mogwai's atmospheric elements.</i></span></li><li><b>Pacificaze - Savage</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 72]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: 'Indie surf rock' is a valid genre, and 'emotional release' is a positive indicator. However, 'punchier, modern production' could be a concern if it means 'highly processed.' It's worth a manual review to check the balance.</i></span></li><li><b>Teutonic Slaughter - Cheap Food</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: While thrash metal is a genre you enjoy, and 'meaner, dirtier, and nastier' sounds appealing, the phrase 'conviction to maintain the glory of old school Teutonic thrash metal' indicates traditionalism rather than innovation or artistic challenge, which are your critical priorities. It's borderline but worth a manual check due to the genre fit and raw description.</i></span></li><li><b>Ryo Fukui - Mellow Dream</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as a 'soulful, excellent record' by a 'jazz innovator' crafted in the 'Coltrane/Tyner mold.' This indicates artistic merit and skill, fitting the appreciation for new musical ideas, though not explicitly challenging or unpredictable.</i></span></li><li><b>Dan Szyller - Journey to the Moon</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: It's described as 'big, bold rock' which aligns with general rock preference, suggesting energy. However, the description lacks terms indicating deeper artistic value or innovation that would warrant a higher score, making it suitable for manual review.</i></span></li>
