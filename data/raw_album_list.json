Golden Tears of Love and Sorrow Orob France is one of the hot beds for modern Metal these days. The album walks a feral line of Post-Black Metal and the expanding horizons of Progressive Metal that it keeps brushing up against like a hand on a forbidden door. It\u2019s harsh, but not primitive, expansive, but never polished to sterility. The interplay creates a kind of emotional chiaroscuro. You feel the darkness, but you can also sense the shapes surviving within it. It\u2019s music that claws upward even as it sinks deeper, and that contradiction is what makes it compelling. Bianca Bianca This was an uncommon sound, fueled by dual opposing vocal styles. They lure you in, with seductive notes, and then eat your soul with all the fire and hatred of Hell itself. The music undulates with the vocals\u2026at times, as raging as a tsunami, and at other times, calm. The fires burn deeply on the album, like a festering wound that has added salt for more pain, and topped with a barbed dagger inserted into the lesion. Pestilential Hymns Thaumaturgy The 2025 release of Pestilential Hymns by Thaumaturgy features eight tracks (an ADHD'ers version of 46 minutes) of pure grind-hate-death metal core encased in a hurricane of filth. Power of Discretion Dave Tinelt Dave Tinelt, Power of Discretion is a raw and hearty, traditional, all metal and power memorable reverse, snap-back ball cap tip to the skateboarding, convenient store, arcade playing child terror of the 80\u2019s I was and still am. Archaeoptimist Spock\u2019s Beard This is one of Progressive Rock\u2019s finest album of the year. Just quirky enough to keep it interesting and intriguing, they explore plenty of unchartered territory on the album but always find their way home. Their musicianship is outstanding, and I did indeed find that the album has a retroactive feeling to it while staying within the modern scene. Magnificent! The Iron Tabernacle The Tabernacle Tabernacle, a trio of musicians from the United Arab Emirites, have come forth with an [\u2026] Vurias Thron The album\u00a0Vurias, by black/death metal band\u00a0Thron, was released September 12th, 2025 on Listenable Records. It's [\u2026] The Grief Sower Behind Starvation \"BEHIND STARVATION\"\u00a0recently released their ep \"The Grief Sower\", just a short album of only 5 [\u2026] Seeking The Absolute Nine Treasures NINE TREASURES is a Chinese folk metal band originated in Beijing, China and formed by [\u2026] Scapegoat Malota They start here and end there, they twist and they parry and they pivot, defying expectations and mocking songwriting norms. Bleed the Wicked, Drown the Damned Cosmic Reaper COSMIC REAPER has stomped out a trail of infernal psych doom with \u201cBleed the Wicked, Drown the Damned.\u201d Dreaming Delusion Gloombound This was a delicious slab of Death and Doom Metal that freely toyed with your emotions. Sometimes, that meant driving an aggressive sound down your throat until you welled with anger, and at other times, you wallowed in despair. They also leave you with just enough hope to come back to the album again and again. Ashes Of Destiny Tales Of Destiny \u201cAshes Of Destiny\u201d offers a blend of traditional Power Metal elements and classical Heavy Metal. The guitars and vocals are the key contributions to the album with good and variable guitar riffs, cool solos, and very versatile vocals Walking On Burning Ground Pitchblack \u201cWalking On Burning Ground\u201d deliver an interesting blend of Death and Groove Metal with some Thrash Metal twists Bittersweet Cassidy Paris Cassidy Paris from Australia is known for her 80\u2019s\u00a0 inspired rock attitude with a modern [\u2026] Apocalyptic Sleep Onsetcold This was a strange album that kept me engaged with a variety of sounds and techniques. One minute, the aggressiveness was turned up past 10, and the next, dreamy passages ensued. Through it all, there was a deep darkness afoot, making sure that you are tainted even when you believe all is well. All fans of Extreme Metal should check out this album, because it boasts a twisted sound you haven\u2019t encountered before. Love Songs Part II Kakihara There\u2019s brutal music, and then there\u2019s KAKIHARA. By the end of the short 10-ish minute run time, you are so exhausted, you feel like you ran an ultra-marathon. They are indeed talented, and each note is in its proper place. For as punishing as their brand of music is, they also seem genuinely attracted to the lighter and more fun side of the industry, and that just makes me like them even more. Silver Bleeds The Sun AFI For more than three decades, AFI has been in a nearly constant state of reinvention. [\u2026] Under Sadistic Law Zadism Unfortunately, the promo came without any bio information, and the band didn\u2019t have an entry [\u2026] The Apocalyptic Aeon Avdagata This is solid Melodic Death Metal. However, a keyboard player was listed, yet I struggled to hear any keys. I would dial them up more in a future mixing session. Also, although the near absence of clean vocals keeps the band pure, they can only help with the melodic side of the music. The band makes no excuses for keeping their sound pure and steeped in the early days of the genre, but taking a few more changes wouldn\u2019t hurt them. Steel, Fire & Ice Fate's Hand I can tell you straight away that the production of the music on \u201cSteel, Fire & Ice\u201d is more than adequate, making what is being played very clear, transparent and therefore all the instruments are easily distinguishable. The riffing that is used is clear, heavy and to the point, as you expect from an Australian band; they usually don\u2019t beat around the bush. Here Goes Nothing Mental Maze The rhythms are widespread, the breaks are plentiful and then intensity is almost claustrophobic. And as MENTAL MAZE doesn\u2019t seem to use any boundaries in how far they can go, it makes that every song on \u201cHere Goes Nothing\u201d has their own identity, whilst the EP as a whole still have the ability to sound very cohesive. Moonshine Tapeworm Electric I actually like what TAPEWORM ELECTRIC is bringing to the table and that I am going to rate this album accordingly. I can only say that if you love your quality Heavy Rock with female vocals, you can\u2019t really go wrong with the music that is available on \u201cMoonshine\u201d. Hostile Wasteland (feat. Wolfpack) Wolfbrigade To narrow down how WOLFBRIGADE does sound, think Punk with some Thrash Metal influences, but more importantly, as if MOT\u00d6RHEAD is playing pure Punk instead of their Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll version. But what is even more impressive in my books is that although I\u2019m not the world\u2019s biggest Punk afficionado, I really am digging what I hear on \u201cHostile Wasteland\u201d. Kill to Live Wolfbrigade I like the fact that the Swedish real-world, brute-force, political Hardcore Punk band WOLFBRIGADE has recorded a live album in their own Wolfden Studios, which they named \u201cKill To Live\u201d. Every song that has been recorded sounds strong, and for 27:33 minutes you have no other choice than to immerse yourself in the surroundings of WOLFBRIGADE and their real-world, brute-force, political Hardcore Punk. Ages Of The Gods Havamal \u201cAges Of The Gods\u201d is a symphonic melodic Death Metal album, driven by a strong orchestral component, which is a main contributor to the epic melodeath sound. The lead guitar solos are a standout feature of the album Frequency Of Illusion Flames \u201cFrequency Of Illusion\u201d is a good mixture of Speed and Thrash Metal. The album has a lot of pace and it is well-balanced across and within the tracks Get Out Of The Rain This House We Built Three years on from their critically acclaimed debut album, This House We Built finally release [\u2026] Onkos Binah So I recently said reviewing Communion in Anguish , by Tithe was out of my [\u2026] Creatures II Creatures Creatures formed in Curitiba in 2019, standing out in Brazil\u2019s extreme metal\u2013dominated scene by championing [\u2026] White Fire Raat This was an excellent album. The deep, fierce aggression is tempered with enough atmospheric and melodic moments to keep it from making you go insane. When they rage, they rage with the fires of Hell, but when they pause, you can breathe with some comfort. Carnage Inc. Carnage Inc. The new self titled EP by thrash metal band from Mumbai India,\u00a0Carnage Inc.,\u00a0comes out swinging [\u2026] Apocryphal Verse Aduanten For a music aficionado who digests 600+ albums a year for the past 10+ years, and is always on the hunt for something new and unique, I can say that this is a sound that is on the fringe of where I see Metal headed in the future, and they are already charting the course. Deep within each layer, there are mysteries waiting to be discovered, and their intelligent approach to songwriting where they are able to control some of the chaos is noteworthy. Alvorecer De \u00daltima Hora Jletylishie This is Black Metal at its most hasty, restless, and breathless, and an album that never stands still, never settles, never lets you fully catch up. The album\u2019s real triumph is how it merges two emotional forces rarely balanced this well: wonder and urgency. The melodic passages make you look upward in awe, while the relentless pace pulls you forward, heart racing, as though you\u2019re chasing a revelation you can almost grasp. Awakening Deteriorot Deteriorot has been around since 1990 and is one of the pioneers of American death [\u2026] 1 2 3 \u2026 1031 1032 Next \u00bb More results...

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

REVIEW: Fit For a King \u2013 Lonely God Fit For a King coming up on almost 20 years as a band and honestly, it\u2019s impressive how consistent they\u2019ve remained throughout their career. Everyone has their favourite records of course; but FFAK\u2019s discography is one that I\u2019ve majorly only heard praise for and considering they\u2019re coming up on their 8th full-length album; that isn\u2019t something you find in a whole lot of bands. They have continuously tweaked and polished their sound without straying too far from their strengths and this remains the case for their upcoming LP Lonely God. The record contains everything their fans would want out of a FFAK project and more, finding the band not only in a stride but with the addition of some new flavours as well. REVIEW: Fox Lake \u2013 New World Heat Fox Lake have made quite the name for themselves over the last few years. Coming out of Denver in 2017, Fox Lake have established a chaos of sound that blurs the lines between metalcore, hardcore, hip-hop and nu-metal. Back in 2023 is when I personally came across the band with the explosive Fear and Loathing EP which not only became one of my favourite releases that year, but it also made its waves across the metalcore and hardcore communities relentlessly. Now, two years later the band have signed with MNRK Heavy and have released sophomore album New World Heat. LIVE REVIEW: Will Smith and support live in Cardiff! Will Smith closed out Depot Live\u2019s 2025 summer series at Cardiff Castle with support from Nile Rodgers and Chic and Rickie and Melvin! REVIEW: Halestorm \u2013 Everest Last week,\u00a0Halestorm\u00a0returned\u00a0with the release of their brand new album\u00a0Everest. A perfect blend of power ballads and classic rock anthems from modern icons,\u00a0Everest\u00a0is a twelve-track masterpiece and one of the best releases of the year so far. The main couple of themes I\u2019ve found is resilience, and being true to yourself.

Grand Theft Auto V Nov 18, 2014 \u2022 Rated M The sprawling sun-soaked metropolis of Los Santos is chock full of self-help coaches, starlets and C-List celebrities, once on top of the media world, now struggling to stay relevant in time of economic malaise and lowest-common-denominator reality TV. Amidst this madness, three unique criminals plan their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street-level hustler in search of opportunities for serious money; Michael, an ex-con whose \"retirement\" is a less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent dude driven by the chance for a quick high and the next big score.

NFL 2K1 Sep 7, 2000 \u2022 Rated E In the end, NFL 2K1 is a deeper, more refined version of the original game. 97 Metascore 16. Half-Life 2 Nov 16, 2004 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2004 PC Game of the Year]  By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling.

[Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience. After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture, a city hidden beneath the sea. Constructed as an idealistic society for a hand picked group of scientists, artists and industrialists, the idealism is no more. Now the city is littered with corpses, wildly powerful guardians roam the corridors as little girls loot the dead, and genetically mutated citizens ambush you at every turn.

Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels, explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them? [2K Games] 96 Metascore 18.

Ozzy\u2019s passing on July 22nd\u00e2\u0080\u0094seventeen days after the Back to the Beginning concert\u00e2\u0080\u0094hit metaldom hard, but it surely hit harder for bands that treat Master of Reality as a sacred text. Videos from the concert, especially of a throned Ozzy performing one last time with the original Sabbath lineup, provide solace, as do covers from legends like Metallica and Slayer . Tragically, 2025 has revitalized Sabbath ; Sabbath -inspired bands walk a tightrope of honoring the original and wilting under its renascence. Merging into the Sabbath lane late in the year is Pale Horse Ritual , a Canadian quartet.\u201d Take a walk on the Ozz side. Master\u2019s Hammer \u2013 Maldor\u00c3\u00b6r Disco Review By Grin Reaper on November 25, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , 24 comments \u201cBesides a stout back catalog, experimental black metal weirdos Master\u2019s Hammer vaunts an intermittent history both in band activity and AMG coverage. After releasing two largely unsung platters of black metal in the early 90s, the band unleashed the terminally forgettable \u00c5\u00a0l\u00c3\u00a1gry and hung up the hammer. In the same year our estimable blog was spawned, Master\u2019s Hammer returned with Mantras , further augmenting their core sound with synth layers and an expanded songwriting tool belt.\u201d Re-raise the Hammer! Bianca \u2013 Bianca [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Kenstrosity on November 25, 2025 in Reviews , Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Black Metal , Doom Metal , 36 comments \u201cItalian semi-super group Bianca , comprised of members from Patristic and Hideous Divinity , stole my attention when their debut self-titled LP dropped at the tail end of October. Stricken by its beauty and flattened by its sheer heft, Bianca impressed me so much that for a good two weeks, it was all I wanted to talk about.\u201d October crushes. Chairmaker \u2013 Leviathan Carcass Review By Andy-War-Hall on November 24, 2025 in Reviews , Death Metal , Grind , 20 comments \u201cShit\u2019s gone to the dogs, man. I don\u2019t need to justify this claim. I know it, you know it, and multi-instrumentalist/university lecturer/UK extreme metal devotee Neil Erskine sure knows it, confirmed thoroughly by his new grind outfit Chairmaker and their debut record Leviathan Carcass .\u201d Sitting in a grindy chair. Perdition Temple \u2013 Malign Apotheosis Review By Mark Z. on November 24, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Metal , 10 comments \u201cSince coming to prominence as the guitarist and primary songwriter of Angelcorpse in the 1990s, Gene Palubicki has been tearing a burning warpath through the extreme metal underground, scorching eardrums with projects like his (sadly defunct) death-thrash band Blasphemic Cruelty and his current collaboration with Morbid Angel \u2019s Steve Tucker and Origin \u2019s John Longstreth in the death metal supergroup Malefic Throne . My favorite of Gene\u2019s post- Angelcorpse projects, however, is Perdition Temple , probably because it sounds the most like Angelcorpse .\u201d The corpses of angels in the temple of sin. Aephanemer \u2013 Utopie [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Grin Reaper on November 24, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Melodic Death Metal , Symphonic Metal , 40 comments \u201cI first encountered Aephanemer between Prokopton and A Dream of Wilderness , and it was love at first listen. Their classical flourishes seamlessly converge with aggressive riffing to develop complex layers of hook-infested earworms so inescapable that no prescription can rid me of their iron thrall. Four years after their last outing, Aephanemer returns with a mature interpretation of their signature sonic stamp.\u201d Apes and hammers and melodeath. Morbikon \u2013 Lost Within the Astral Crypts By Owlswald on November 23, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , 22 comments \u201cWhen he\u2019s not dealing in the Slime and Punishment of Municipal Waste or pissing off the neighbors with Iron Reagan , axe-wielder Phil \u201cLandphil\u201d Hall channels his focus into Morbikon . Formed in 2020, Hall\u2019s black metal side-project earned recognition from AMG Industries when Ferox Ferox highlighted the supergroup\u2019s debut, Ov Mournful Twilight , as his surprise record of 2022. Rooted in all things kvlt and trve, the album\u2019s second wave frostbitten anthems plunged into the remnants of burned churches and stale corpse paint, resulting in \u201ceight meloblack rippers calibrated to bring winter to your soul and whiplash to your neck.\u201d\u201d Gaze into the Morb. Depravity \u2013 Bestial Possession Review By Kenstrosity on November 22, 2025 in Reviews , Death Metal , 64 comments \u201cSince the release of Evil Upheaval in early 2018, I fell head over heels for Aussie death metal quintet Depravity . Evil Upheaval always going to be a difficult debut to follow, but Grand Malevolence did its very best and largely matched the debut\u2019s sheer heft and vicious energy. Five long years spans the gap between then and now, with third salvo Bestial Possession , threatening to pummel me into dust. Little does Depravity know how badly I want it.\u201d Depraved kinks and frightful brutality. Ildaruni \u2013 Divinum Sanguinem Review By Andy-War-Hall on November 21, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , 8 comments \u201cThe mystic, the subliminal, the macabre: the fixings of good black metal and the bread and butter of Armenian pagans Ildaruni . Four years ago, they entered the blackened sphere with their debut Beyond Unseen Gateways , a folk-infused take on black metal that, while promising in several regards, felt bloated and unfocused. Its pagan, medieval-y acoustic passages felt tacked on, lethargic and a bit hokey, and I think Ildaruni agree with my assessment, as this year\u2019s Divinum Sanguinem ditches the lutes and stuff for \u201ca more tenebrous and ferocious black metal path.\u201d Mysteries of ill-niquity. Antino\u00c3\u00ab \u2013 The Fold Review By Tyme on November 21, 2025 in Reviews , Ambient , Not Metal , 17 comments \u201cAs the whispering winds of winter begin to blow colder through my neck of the woods, a time of year when fires get cozier, quaffed beers get darker, and we here at AMG begin to rhapsodize on things missed and regale readers with things listed, I found myself still searching for a near-end-of-year something new. When I saw Antino\u00c3\u00ab \u2019s Dark Essence Records debut, The Fold , blurbily described as \u2018Neoclassical Folk meets melancholy Pop with a Metal attitude,\u2019 I was intrigued. Descending from the mountains of Madrid, Antino\u00c3\u00ab is the passion project of pianist and vocalist Teresa Marraco.\u201d Cold keys in a cruel world.

Maximum Rocknroll wants to review everything that comes out in the world of underground punk rock, hardcore, garage, post-punk, thrash, etc. No major labels or labels exclusively distributed by major-owned distributors, no reviews of test pressings or promo CDs without final artwork. We reserve the right to reject releases on the basis of content. Music without vocals or drums will not be considered. All music submitted for review must have been released (or reissued) within the last two years. Please include contact information and let us know where your band is from! Aggravate Black Glass cassette Solid first offering from San Diego\u2019s AGGRAVATE. The band has one foot firmly planted in traditional USHC thanks to the straightforward vocals, but otherwise the proceedings are more atmospheric and heavier than your usual fare, almost approaching stadium crust. Overall not bad; I\u2019ll be curious to see what direction they go from here. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Human Future Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Bacarrudas Bleed Out, Get Pushed Off a Cliff, Sink to the Bottom of a Lake, and Play a Halloween Monster House Party! LP The title says it all, folks. A double LP full of campy, over-the-top, \u201960s-inspired monster madness straight out of Philadelphia. It\u2019s worthy of a seasonal spin during your next Pagan house party or seasonal sockhop. Songs like \u201cDracula\u2019s Castle\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s in Love with Frankenstein\u2019s Monster\u201d are loaded with all the reverb and tremolo of your fave \u201960s and \u201970s novelty records, and much to my enjoyment, they lean into the humor and campiness. It reminds me of the kind of stuff I would find in a used dollar bin and would scoop up without hesitation. It\u2019s pressed at 45 RPM on 12\u201d which adds to the novelty vibe. Overall, it\u2019s a fun record without a ton of memorable moments, but deserving of a listen if you\u2019re into the schtick. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Moms Basement / Schuylkill Beat Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Cold Summer Den Umst\u00e4nden Entsprechend 12\u2033 Good mix of post-punk and more classic punk rock\u2014their ability to go from the classically post-punk guitar in verses into a distorted explosion in the choruses was awesome. I really appreciated the noise and intensity that they kept up throughout, definitely a solid record. Reviewer Emma Miller Label It's Eleven Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Destiny Bond The Love LP Extremely solid effort that kicks into full gear immediately. Blistering guitar solos paired with a blood-curdling screamer and a tight, lightning-fast rhythm section. There\u2019s a little bit of keyboard action laced throughout that I wish was a bit more consistent and louder, but that\u2019s my only real complaint. Sounding a bit like their labelmates GUMM, DESTINY BOND also combines the best parts of youth crew hardcore (gang vocals and groovy, mosh-inducing tempos) with classic rock\u2019n\u2019roll mentality (charismatic singer, catchy riffs, and palpable energy). This is a great record and a fantastic addition to the Convulse library, which has hosted some real ten-out-of-ten albums over these last few years. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Convulse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Electric Prawns 2 Heavy Shitters cassette Insanely catchy collection of garage punk tunes from Australia that was almost scrapped by the band? Folks, why? It\u2019s so good. If you like JAY REATARD or TEE VEE REPAIRMANN, give it a listen and soak in the rock\u2019n\u2019roll grit, the near-bubblegum vocals on tracks like \u201cMine Tonight\u201d (\u201cMake you mine toooo-niiiiiighttt\u201d), and the old school keys that bubble up like ? AND THE MYSTERIANS playing with the SPITS. Hooks hooking into more hooks on every song had me writing one word next to each song while listening: classic. Like the song \u201cBorned to Rock,\u201d ELECTRIC PRAWNS 2 were in fact borned to rock. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Forced Humility Burning Inside EP Burly, punishing hardcore that draws from the wellspring of \u201980s NYHC like the ABUSED or the MOB (the good stuff). Everything is outsized and menacing, with gang chants and guitar leads as you might expect, particularly if you\u2019ve encountered their demo from 2023. Sharing members with FORESEEN may also be a helpful bit of knowledge to have, another band to masterfully modernize old school influences. FORCED HUMILITY doesn\u2019t spare the hooks and isn\u2019t afraid to introduce a harmony, but make no mistake\u2014this shit is brutal and unsparing. An ass-beater, to be sure. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Heavy Lag / Sekunderna / Teenage Bigfoot / TV Cop split LP I love splits. This one is a cool showcase of the current dirt pop scene, with each band contributing two original songs and one cover. If that\u2019s not enough for you, it even comes with a fifteen-page zine. The whole affair gives off heavy MARKED MEN or RADIOACTIVITY vibes, so it should come as no surprise that three of the bands either recorded or mastered their tracks with Jeff Burke. The original songs are a good example of what each band brings to the table, but the covers are the real gems here. TV COP covering MOLLY HATCHET just might be my favorite track on the split; pop punks covering Southern rock and doing it justice??? I\u2019m into it. The TEENAGE BIGFOOT originals remind me of walking into a Hot Topic circa 2003. Not into it. On the other hand, their cover of \u201cDreams\u201d by the CRANBERRIES was stuck in my head for days, and I really dislike that band! For the uninitiated, I don\u2019t feel like anything on here will make any of these bands your new favorite. But for existing fans, Jeff Burke worshippers, or anyone looking for a few killer dirt pop covers, this LP will feel right at home in your collection. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Bloated Kat Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Imploders Targeted for Termination LP Static Shock delivers the second LP from IMPLODERS, a maddeningly fast, no-frills hardcore strike. Quick riffs, shredded vocals, constant energy\u2014tight and well-executed, but familiar. A solid, enjoyable record that stays in its lane. Ideal for listeners wanting straightforward speed and power. Static Shock trae el segundo LP de IMPLODERS, un ataque directo y enloquecedor de hardcore r\u00e1pido y sin aditivos. La banda ejecuta bien: riffs veloces, voces mordidas y energ\u00eda constante. Es s\u00f3lido y disfrutable, pero no sorprende ni rompe el molde. Hardcore bien hecho, ideal para quienes buscan velocidad pura. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Static Shock Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Jet! Everybody Plays the Game / Hear Me Sheila 7\u2033 reissue Until about five years ago, JET! was seemingly a complete unknown, nary a footnote in the annals of New Jersey power pop (which is actually New Jersey\u2019s top export as a state, not \u201cchemicals\u201d as the internet may try to make you believe). JET! formed in Toms River, cut two of the greatest power pop 45s ever, and disappeared. Luckily, a NJ collector uncovered a stack of deadstock copies of those two singles, and soon us obsessives got our grubby little hands on copies of our own. And now, the immaculate Fish & Cheap Records continue to do what they do best and get another obscure slab to the masses. \u201cEverybody Plays the Game\u201d and \u201cHere Me Sheila\u201d represent the band\u2019s second single, with the A-side being a little more driving than their first single \u201cPlease Mister Radio.\u201d While the decision to be a bit more rocking may have caused the rift in the band that led to their split, they still managed to capture lightning in a second bottle. If you have even a passing interest in punky power pop, all four of their songs are an absolute must, and Fish & Cheap are making it so the sounds aren\u2019t confined to the greasy collectors shelves. With any luck, they\u2019ll give the first release the reissue treatment as well. Get this, now. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Fish & Cheap Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Knowso Hypnotic Smack LP Cleveland duo KNOWSO, consisting of Nathan Ward (CRUELSTER, PERVERTS AGAIN, the CARP) and Jayson Gerycz (CLOUD NOTHINGS), return with Hypnotic Smack , a wiry, offbeat LP that fits neatly into the city\u2019s long tradition of bent punk weirdos. Earlier MRR reviewers have namedropped DEVO, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART, NOMEANSNO fronted by Steve Albini, and SERVOTRON when trying to pin this band down, and those touchpoints still make sense: jerky rhythms, odd vocal phrasing, and a nervous, sci-fi pulse that feels both mechanical and human. Must be something in the water in Cleveland, turning out band after band of weirdos who twist punk into performance art and still make it catchy. It\u2019s got humor, it\u2019s upbeat and angular, but it doesn\u2019t quite stick for me. All those reference points are ultimately more interesting than what comes through here. Maybe I\u2019m just wishing they\u2019d lean harder into it. The track \u201cSacred Mystery\u201d was a high point, a glimpse of the extra bite I wish the rest of the record had. In today\u2019s world, this isn\u2019t that weird or abrasive. Maybe it\u2019s a nonthreatening entry point for a voyage toward more esoteric pleasures. Eleven songs, thirty minutes. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Sorry State Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Lutheran Heat Hi Again LP Sophomore album of shambling, poppy indie punk from Minneapolis. They pull from multiple influences\u2014Motown, \u201960s pop, Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, Flying Nun Records, and contemporaries the BABIES\u2014in the same way Fred Thomas did with SATURDAY LOOKS GOOD TO ME. They nail that mix of scruffy punk attitude with melodic hooks the way that ex-BANANAS drummer Scott Miller did with his bands NAR and especially BRIGHT IDEAS. Reviewer Tim Janchar Label Pi\u00f1ata Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Mexoff / Negative Path split LP Jesus Christ, did they find enough labels to help release this thing? Classic fastcore powerviolence, but both bands sound different enough to keep things interesting. MEXOFF pulls double grunting vocal duties, sounding like MAN IS THE BASTARD and CAPTAIN THREE LEG with a very prominent, heavy bass. There\u2019s a bit of a crusty edge here as well. NEGATIVE PATH leans a little closer to the D-beat side of the spectrum and is a tad more guitar-heavy, with thrash-like solos and unique vocal tones; they sound like a pack of wild coyotes. There\u2019s over two dozen tracks piled onto this disc and none of them go over a minute-and-a-half. That\u2019s pure perfection right there. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Correctional Facility / Crapoulet / Drinkin' Beer in Bandana / Here And Now / Hecatombe / Loner Cult / Nothing to Harvest / Svab Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Morwan Vse Po Kolu, Znovu LP MORWAN began as a solo project by Alex Ashtaui in Kiev, Ukraine around 2019, but now MORWAN is a full band out of Berlin with Alex at the helm to guide the band into the darkest and heaviest post-punk territory ever to be explored. Their new album Vse Po Kolu, Znovu is an emotional journey through inspirations, ranging from things that sound like KILLING JOKE and MINISTRY to noisy psych rock \u00e0 la OH SEES. The guitar work on this album is really cool with its maximum-velocity plucking that is very surfy but also very rhythmic at times, and with its droning repetition, the sounds begin to distort in your mind as other influences emerge. This album would be perfect for a winter night while watching snow fall, especially the epic, nearly eight-minute closer \u201c\u041d\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0439\u201d as it enters a shoegaze/post-hardcore realm. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Feel It Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Neck Breather Set cassette Powerviolence is a micro-genre that strives at extremes, be it in velocity, tempo shifts, drama, or self-awareness. It became somewhat oversaturated some years ago with the rise in popularity of some bands, then went back \u201dunderground\u201d (it was never mainstream, but it used to be very niche), and only the strongest survived. NECK BREATHER is one of those cases\u2014some of the freshest-sounding modern powerviolence that I\u2019ve heard in a while, not the silly comedic powerviolence but the apocalyptic, nihilist kind like IRON LUNG. The sonic violence only gets amped up by the genius mastering by maniac James Plotkin (go check out OLD LADY DRIVERS or KHANATE if you\u2019re ready to die). Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Plane Crash Too Little Too Late EP The aspiration here is to make nostalgic, gritty rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but there\u2019s something charmingly off-kilter about the presentation that makes it more than just a pale shade of something we\u2019ve all heard before. Mark Death\u2019s vocals have that sort of monotone sociopathy to them, while the guitar has a direct-in compression that gives everything a sort of detachedness that manages to elevate the tightly-written material from \u201cJOHNNY THUNDERS knock-off\u201d to something much more odd and a hell of a lot of fun. There\u2019s a meager few tracks here to sink your teeth into, but the hand-hewn quality (see also: the horrorcore high school notebook cover art) makes it worth your time. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Hate Street Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Profit and Murder Doomed to Fail LP \u201cPROFIT AND MURDER? Are they still around? How long have they been playing? Since the 19th century?\u201d is likely to be the most common reaction to this brand new album, Doomed to Fail . It was certainly mine as I strongly, and perhaps irremediably, associate this German band with the \u201900s so that I am constantly surprised to hear about them. I hadn\u2019t listened to them in ages and only had a vague memory of what they were supposed to be about: rather typical old school crust punk. And to my great relief, Alzheimer\u2019s is still a long way off, because PROFIT AND MURDER plays precisely old school traditional crustcore, with two vocalists and something to say. Hurray! Despite being around since 2000, it seems that trends and fashion have had no effect whatsoever on the band\u2019s sound, impervious to change, which in this case is commendable in my opinion. Doomed to Fail can be said to be a trip down the \u201990s and early \u201900s Eurocrust memory lane, one I am happy to take, not out of nostalgia but because it\u2019s very well-done, with sincerity. Pummeling, fast, with a Scandi touch and a sense of confident simplicity that clicks. Bands like HIATUS, \u201900s VISIONS OF WAR, or 3-WAY CUM got invites of course, and PROFIT AND MURDER is one of the last instances of this peculiar species. I love that one. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Bomb-All / Uwaga \u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9 / Wild Wild East Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Regimiento Spansul Sorpresas en el Barro EP A short-lived unit out of early 1980s Valencia, REGIMIENTO SPANSUL left only the four tracks on this 7\u201d behind as evidence of their rowdy little run. The sounds here range from spirited first-wave inspiration (\u201cHaciendo Surf en Marte\u201d) to prickly and groovy post-punk (\u201cLa Ejecuci\u00f3n\u201d). If you\u2019ve been itching for some catchy and obscure Spanish nuggets, pick up this EP and consider yourself scratched. Reviewer Jason Harding Label El Mascarat / Prohibido Bailar / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Shox Human Furniture cassette Wow. This is almost like perfect pop music. Vocals are soft, but assertive. The music itself is also soft, but with some excellent distortion. They marry remarkably well, which I suppose shouldn\u2019t really be a surprise, but it was noteworthy to me. The pace is measured and deliberate. Kind of reminds me of early BLUR or the DANDY WARHOLS. If you\u2019re familiar with the band GLITZ, that also comes to mind. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Quality Time Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Soga Corrosi\u00f3n LP Blistering punk from Mexico City masters SOGA. Their 2018 demo made a huge splash, ultimately making its way to vinyl thanks to the good folks at Iron Lung, so naturally their debut album has garnered a frenzy of excitement. No need to be coy here, it\u2019s fucking good. I think what sets SOGA apart is the curiosity they employ, pulling on threads that are woven into the broad tapestry of hardcore punk. At times they\u2019re unrelenting and ferocious, like on \u201cLa Respuest,\u201d and \u201cAniquilar.\u201d Without breaking character or missing a beat, they can flip a switch and delve into a catchy, \u201977-style rave-up like \u201cVoy Por Un Mai Camino.\u201d Gloriously genre-bending, pissed-off, political punk. Sign me the fuck up! Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Stranglehold Demo 2024 cassette Birmingham hardcore (with a capital H) born from the ashes of SUPPRESS. Massive-sounding hardcore in the vein of STRIFE (or, as they put it, \u201cbands that sound like they\u2019re straightedge but aren\u2019t\u201d), with mosh parts and melody standing side-by-side, and hyped-up sing-along queues. This is the type of hardcore that gets the blood boiling, or the dance moves in check. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Cruzade / Rest Assured / Warpath Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ugly Stick Debut LP From Ohio in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, this is definitely my sort of thing, but they\u2019re brand new to me. It\u2019s definitely got a REPLACEMENTS feel to it. It\u2019s jangly and raw and has a good dash of country and folk going on. I gather from the liner notes and some online research that this is a reissue, but that\u2019s not a certainty for me. There\u2019s an honesty in this one that\u2019s compelling. It\u2019s also pretty well-done. It\u2019s catchy and melodic, gritty, and really both fun and cool to listen to. Other similarities\u2026what if you crossed the DILS with RANK AND FILE? And does anyone remember (IMPATIENT) YOUTH? Good shit. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Good Times Rock N Roll Club Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Winston Hytwr\u2019s Perfect Harmony Perfect Harmony cassette Buckle in for this Ohio-based adventure; an ever-meandering river of jangle pop/lo-fi bedroom pop/egg-punk/indie rock awaits on this seven-song cassette. As soon as you think you\u2019ve got the band figured out, WINSTON and co. throw you a curveball, leaving you guessing once more. The unexpected post-punk track \u201cSubject of Interest\u201d is unbelievably catchy and memorable, from its repetitive bass lines, noodly guitar leads, and impressively lackadaisically delivered vocals. It almost feels like the band is trying to play a slightly different sub-genre of the greater punk world with each track on this cassette. Perhaps this is being done to show us, the listener, that all of these sub-genres can in fact exist in Perfect Harmony . Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Clean Demon Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 V/A Chaos for Christmas CD This starts with a real heartbreaker of a seasonal song about not singing door-to-door because the singer is awfully sad about things and stuff (sad face emoji). I bet these songs were a real hoot to write (hoot emoji). The songs are mostly upbeat in sound but downbeat in jolliness, and are peppered with language that will get you on the \u201cnaughty list\u201d for certain (uh-oh emoji). My friend Derek loves Christmas-themed punk stuff so he can sprinkle in a few tunes he enjoys between the MARIAH CAREY and BING CROSBY family favorites Xmas playlist (thumbs up emoji), so at least one of these is already in a stocking in Michigan (shrug emoji). Reviewer Tony Party Label Rejected Youth Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 An Slua Sure Look It LP It\u2019s time to face an uncomfortable truth\u2014a lot of modern Oi! is complete and utter shite. It\u2019s either hardcore lite made by people in big shorts, or it\u2019s pop punk about the pub made by people in flat caps they bought off Amazon. It\u2019s bland, overproduced, insipid bollocks . So when I get the chance to listen to something truly good, not just \u201cgenre good\u201d but actually good, it\u2019s a real treat. AN SLUA is that treat. The Sligo skins have released a modern classic in their debut. Joining luminaries like OI POLLOI and the OPPRESSED in being fiercely political and not being afraid to nail their (correct) colours to the mast at a time when cowards are happy to be fencesitters, they also know their way around a tune. Catchy as fuck, lyrically whip-smart, and choruses that beg to be shouted on the terraces. This is, quite simply, class. Any time you don\u2019t bother listening to this is time wasted. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Distroy / Longshot Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bad to Worse These Are Our Streets cassette One of those bands that isn\u2019t really sure what they want to sound like. Swapping between an amalgamation of HOT WATER MUSIC, O PIONEERS!, CRO-MAGS, and CHOKING VICTIM, the only consistent variable is the vocalist who maintains the same dynamic throughout the entire record. While the stamina is impressive, the lack of vocal nuance is a tad dry. The gang vocals laden throughout sound great and pepper in a much needed charisma boost. A release where everyone involved is obviously quite talented, but it all sounds a bit dated. The whole orgcore motif combining the posi-tough-guy image with the sentimental longing for \u201chome\u201d was fresh fifteen years ago but still hasn\u2019t hit its nostalgia period, it just sounds stale. However, if you still pine for that era, then you\u2019ll love this. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Beta Maximo \u00daltimo Asalto cassette As is more often than not the case, Knuckles on Stun brings us yet another absolute smash hit! BETA MAXIMO is a wildly prolific garage punk band from Spain with more releases than some bands have songs. Eight catchy and driving tracks, most of which are pushed over the top by having almost sickeningly poppy synth licks. I absolutely love this! I truly hope that my Spanish not being very good might mean there is a chance that \u00daltimo Asalto is not the band\u2019s way of telling us that this is their final release. If that is the case, then I really hope I am of the lucky 25 people to get a copy of the forthcoming BETA MAXIMO discography cassette on Knuckles on Stun, as that is the standard amount that label makes of each of their releases (this one included), so get one while you can. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bezette Stad F.A.N.O.N. 12\u2033 Belgian hardcore band BEZETTE STAD has been releasing music for about five years now. Their latest release F.A.N.O.N. is a six-song 12\u2033 that explores our contemporary global scenario with articulate hardcore blended with D-beat, as if PAINT IT BLACK started hanging out with DISCHARGE. From the bass-heavy opener of \u201cReform\u201d to the metallic pummeling and digital glitching in closer \u201c28 Days\u201d the F.A.N.O.N. 12\u2033 is six slices of hardcore hellion heaven, and you need to put it in your ear holes posthaste. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Shield Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Celebration Summer / Wolf-Face DCxPC Live, Volume 42 split LP Recorded live at The Fest, DCxPC Live, Volume 42 pairs CELEBRATION SUMMER from DC. with Florida\u2019s WOLF-FACE for two distinct takes on melodic punk energy. CELEBRATION SUMMER lean into earnest, \u201990s-style melodic punk showing their JAWBREAKER and TILTWHEEL influences. WOLF-FACE counters with a more playful set that mixes their Teen Wolf basketball-punk personas with solid, tuneful, orgcore-flavored \u201c whoaaaaa \u201d sing-alongs, including a cover of TV ON THE RADIO\u2019s \u201cWolf Like Me\u201d and a live version of \u201cI Wanna Be a Homo(sapien)\u201d with a hirsute wink toward SCREECHING WEASEL. The recording quality is rough, but it feels like an honest snapshot of two bands connecting with a crowd. Limited to 200 copies on this yellowish color that someone decided to call \u201csummer moon.\u201d Reviewer Jeff Cost Label DCxPC Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Cell Rot Parasite LP This Bay Area grindcore outfit mixes with sludge and powerviolence in a recipe for chaos at its most unrelenting. CELL ROT\u2019s Parasite is a slab of total aggression\u2014eleven tracks that sound like they were recorded inside a pressure cooker. The production is dense but not dull; each blastbeat and low-end rumble slices through with terrifying precision. Vocals are guttural, halfway between a scream and a cave echo, backed by riffs that refuse to stay in one tempo for more than two seconds. There\u2019s a sharp political and existential edge here\u2014nihilism meets confrontation. Convulse keeps releasing records that make the underground feel dangerous again. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Convulse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Christopher Alan Durham Basement Debris 2021\u20132025 cassette Well, there\u2019s a confusing one in every batch. This C.A.D. cassette, which doesn\u2019t have the full name of the artist on it anywhere (and the top of the \u201cC\u201d on the front cover is cut off to the point that I would have sworn it said LAD), is a solo acoustic cassette of four-track songs recorded by CHRISTOPHER ALAN DURHAM. He is a member of a full band out of Detroit, Michigan under the name C.A.D. AND THE PEACETIME CONSUMERS, which is more throwback, freak-out rock\u2019n\u2019roll stuff. This tape, however, I just kind of can\u2019t understand. Super lo-fi, jangly guitar, jazzy, jammy art. There\u2019s drums on at least one of the songs which kept my interest a little more, but the acoustic stuff just feels like a budget bastard amalgamation of REED, DYLAN, and BEEFHEART, and I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret\u2026it doesn\u2019t mix well. The final track, \u201cWalk in the Park,\u201d certainly did not live up to its name\u2014what an absolute slog to get through, clocking in at over four minutes and confusing me the entire time. It did receive a little baffled interest from one of my cats though, looking around with complete bewilderment whenever the sampled bird whistles were peppered in. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label All Gone Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Enyor Catalunya En Blanc i Negre LP Catalan Oi! that tosses an interesting curveball. Of all the stylistic mashups, an indie rock twist was about the last thing I was expecting. Musically, this lands squarely in lo-fi Revolution Summer territory, but the vocals are pure boot boy fodder. I\u2019m convinced that with a different vocal delivery, this would fall into a vastly different genre altogether. Smash together RITES OF SPRING with the TEMPLARS, if you can imagine such an amalgamation. Nine tracks, with a NEGATIVE APPROACH cover for good measure. A\u00a0 pioneering attempt to be sure, but the incongruity is hard to get past. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Fan Club Stimulation EP Formerly known as LYSOL, Seattle\u2019s FAN CLUB hits a new high on Stimulation , a five-song, six-minute blast of incendiary hardcore punk with a rock\u2019n\u2019roll undercurrent. The songs tear forward with relentless motion and sharp, swaggering energy\u2014closer to SEUDO YOUTH in pace and delivery than the slower grind of a lot of their earlier material. It recalls \u201cBlessures Graves,\u201d the standout from LYSOL\u2019s Soup for My Family , where they ditched mid-tempo for full-throttle attack but somehow held on to the strut. It\u2019s a sound that feels urgent, alive, and fully realized. One of the best things I heard all summer, and I swear this band keeps getting better the faster they move. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Feel It Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Fretbuzz Nothing is Just Nothing / It\u2019s So Hard 7\u2033 My comparisons will draw some very solid lines as to whether you want to grab this: stir in some modern MOVING TARGETS + FEELIES + GIN BLOSSOMS + later 2024-era SOUL ASYLUM, pleasant-sounding indie rock, and you get the picture. These FRETBUZZ songs hover in a cloudy space where if they actually had some fret buzzing going on, or pushed a little harder in any direction, it would stand out more. Look, at the end of the day, this is a great single that hits on power pop in the \u201990s Midwestern style and has all the right points of a good record. The flipside \u201cIt\u2019s So Hard\u201d is a bit more driving, but still not speeding through any school zones. Reviewer Tony Party Label Target Earth Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Grimly Pleased I\u2019ll Choose It EP This is short, to-the-point, and excellent. Bouncy cowpunk that inevitably brings to mind stuff like THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS and maybe the spirit of Hitler Bad -era VANDALS (in a good way!). Consistency is impressive for these guys, they continue to deliver bouncy-to-the-point-of-dance-y jams with clever, even poignant lyrics. Music like this rewards multiple listens if you click with it, though I imagine the overall sunny disposition may put some people off. Not me though, this world is a fucking nightmare and spending eight punk, fun minutes with some clever music is decidedly on the menu. Reviewer Daniel Z. Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Hellshock XXV 12\u2033 It seems not so long ago since HELLSHOCK\u2019s 2022 LP came out, a record I could not quite totally get into, I must admit, because it relied too much on classic death metal and it basically lost me\u2014of course, it was certainly more than good enough when in the mood for mean, BOLT THROWER-flavoured music. The fantasy-themed cover of this new LP looks like a scene from The Lord of the Rings and is (I can barely write it) in colour, undeniably a blasphemous cardinal scene in the crust realm. I was more than a little skeptical before playing this, and how wrong I was. The lugubrious BOLT THROWER worship still rules, but the recruitment of Todd Burdette on second guitar brings a significantly different vibe to the songwriting, making it more epic, murkier, but still generating that ominous atmospheric heaviness. The songs are rather long, thoughtfully built, and tell great, albeit really fucking dark, stories. HELLSHOCK are still certainly themselves, and the album will not disappoint fans of gruff metal crust and stenchcore revivalists, but they also offer something more articulate, progressive even, and dare I say it, subtle here (assuming the perfect soundtrack for a malevolent skeleton armies and being growled at by a zombified bear fit the concept of subtlety). The LP has been on heavy rotation here, and I see it as the perfect evolution for the band. XXV is bound to become a classic crust album, not because it abides by the rulebook, but because it creates something new and inventive without discarding the band\u2019s identity. They do not sound alike, but I see records like COUNTERBLAST\u2019s Balance of Pain or SKAVEN\u2019s EP in much the same way. You know what to do. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Agipunk / Black Water Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Love Story in Blood Red Everything\u2019s Everywhere LP Presumably compiling their entire oeuvre, the ever-reliable Good Times Rock N Roll Club out of New York has provided us with the works of a mid-2000s gem of a project entitled LOVE STORY IN BLOOD RED. With 27 tracks in all, there is more than plenty to digest here. For fans of the vocal stylings of JONATHAN RICHMAN, this collection comes highly recommended. The main brainchild here, Jason Frederick, along with a handful of bandmates over the lifetime of the project, has a real knack for attention-grabbing lyrics and instrumentation. The band/project seemed to exist for only about four years in the Chicagoland area, and while I can\u2019t speak to their influence or impact at the time, getting the chance to dig into these songs twenty years later is a real treat. Surely meant to be digested over time, these dozens of tracks feel like an awesome time capsule that is worth the time to take in in its entirety, even if that takes several listens. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Good Times Rock N Roll Club Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Mecht Mensch Anthology LP Absolutely legendary early \u201880s Wisconsin hardcore. The \u201cMechanical Men\u201d tore through the dairyland with mechanical precision when they dropped one holy grail of Midwest punk, the Acceptance EP, in 1983, a furious little record that nailed paranoia, politics, and pure punk anger to the classics wall. They didn\u2019t stick around long, but their sound seeped into the underground. No Coast resurrected MECHT MENSCH\u2019s entire recorded catalog with Anthology , pulling together the aforementioned Acceptance EP, compilation tracks, demos, and live recordings, all remastered from the original reels, even sourced from Henry Rollins\u2019s archive. To complete the deluxe treatment, there is a gatefold sleeve, full-size zine packed with flyers and interviews, plus a huge poster. More than a nostalgia piece, it is a hardcore time capsule. A loud reminder that hardcore will never die. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label No Coast Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Personal Hell Window Painted Shut LP Lumbering and nasty hardcore from West Yorkshire\u2019s PERSONAL HELL, who occasionally wade into neo-crust territory on their new LP Window Painted Shut . It sounds like the band spared no expense on the production of this album: the guitars are thick and crunchy, the rhythm section is low and burly, and the vocals are desperate and right at the front of the mix. There isn\u2019t a bad song in the bunch, but I prefer the quicker cuts, like the excellent \u201cThe Brine.\u201d Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Natural Sciences Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Petty Crime Brighton, UK, 1999 EP A year after putting out one of the best 7\u201ds of the \u201990s (1998\u2019s Forfeit Intent EP) on one of the greatest labels of the \u201990s (Slampt Underground Organisation forever), Helen White and Layla Gibbon of PETTY CRIME took their short, sharp girl-gang post-punk missives to the domestic interior space of a literal bedroom, recording three new tracks to cassette that remained unheard until now. Intimate, immediate, and with a joyously shambolic recklessness, Brighton, UK, 1999 is not unlike eavesdropping on conspiratorial plots being devised from the other side of a paper-thin wall\u2014when Helen and Layla sing and shout about truth and detachment and misplaced trust, it\u2019s always with an underlying sense of danger. Taut bass weaves around sparse scratches of guitar, desperate rhythms are pounded out on household objects functioning as makeshift drums, and the ultra-lo-fi presentation of it all truly underscores the feeling of stumbling on a radical secret straight from the organizing committee of the boy/girl revolution. A life-affirming document! Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Jabs / Raw Sugar Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ruby Rash Merit Badges cassette Heavy goth and deathrock-inflected synth punk with fuzzy low-end crunch, pounding electronic drums, and melodic, melancholic vocals. Tempos range from creepy crawlers like the gorgeous shoegaze-y alternate reality club hit \u201cDream Eater\u201d to the faster punk beat of \u201cBroken Moon,\u201d but all maintain the same morose power. Recommended for fans of bands like HORROR VACUI and PINKISH BLACK, RUBY RASH creates dark, subwoofer-rattling atmospheres perfect for those of us who enjoy spooky season year-round. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Skeleton City Souvenirs Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Sinkhole Groping for Trout LP Vinyl re-release for the originally CD-only debut album by this \u201990s pop punk standout. I have a pretty positive memory of this band from that era; they seemed more invested in songcraft than a lot of their contemporaries, and listening to it now that rings even more true. There\u2019s just more going on musically even when the goal is catchy, melodic punk rock. The recording has a new mastering job that elevates the different components, putting the guitars and melodious vocals right in your\u00a0 face. I will say, the band always lacked a little bit of bite for my taste and that still holds true now, but not to the massive detriment of the record. Somewhere between WESTON and SQUIRTGUN with a dash of GAMEFACE, this is very, very \u201990s. It sounds a lot better than it did in \u201994 and has a couple comp/single bonus tracks too, a fine release overall. Reviewer Daniel Z. Label Dead Broke Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Sklitakling Normal Drift LP Loved these guys! Their layering really made the songs feel super whole and created this tense, thick atmosphere. I loved the bass lines and cascading vocals, which were both screamy and melodic at the same time. If you like anything punk, check these guys out. Reviewer Emma Miller Label Back to Beat Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Star 99 Gaman LP \u201cKill,\u201d the first song, is terrific, with melody, clarity, and drive. I love songs that can pin a time of year outside of basic imagery associated with color, touch, smell. When Saoirse sings about cicadas, it collapses on time of year with sight, smell, and sound with one word; she has delivered a near-perfect line. However, after this song the LP starts some twists and turns that flow into dream pop, indie rock, and things like that. There are two distinct songwriters, and their styles vary in a way that makes me wish this were a split LP with two different bands. Both styles are similar but different enough to make the Gaman LP not flow. Also, I personally get a bit bored with broken-hearted boys with troubles, and half of this LP is that. I\u2019d say this is for folks that like the MEASURE, P.S. ELIOT, RADIATOR HOSPITAL, the AMBULARS, and such. Reviewer Tony Party Label Lauren Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Static\u00f8 Absurdity of This World LP With a creative flavor of hardcore out of Serbia, this first full-length from STATIC\u00d8 mixes influences to create a unique cohesion. Infused with relentless Scandi-punk pummeling, it pushes the spirit of UK82 to aggravated extremes, creating a fitting backdrop for their intensely passionate social and political commentary. This union is surprisingly natural, demonstrating the unspoken handshake that exists between the styles while creating a futuristic feel that rings maybe loudest in the chaotic title track. When the closing \u201cThe End\u201d comes on, echoing the morbid march of SIEGE\u2019s \u201cGrim Reaper,\u201d it\u2019s hard to imagine a cooler conclusion. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Ayran Sounds / Onesna\u017eevanje Uma / Out of the Darkness / Refuse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Top Dollar Objects of Misfortune EP Get ready for the TOP DOLLAR stomp! Objects of Misfortune is an eight-track beast of an EP from New York\u2019s TOP DOLLAR released on 11PM Records, the go-to label for all the best \u201cmodern\u201d hardcore releases. Two years after their excellent demo, TOP DOLLAR unleashes their New York youth-crew-styled hardcore played at maximum velocity, with an unpredictable edge \u00e0 la Youth Attack Records. All bangers, no fillers, with impeccable energy throughout, this is a record that will be spinning on my turntable for a long time. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label 11 PM Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 A\u0155esi Aurrera Beti 12\u2033 I\u2019ll be the first to admit that my knowledge of the Basque language leaves much to be desired, which is an enormous shame since Mendeku Diskak has been instrumental in spotlighting what continues to be a verdant and fertile scene of top-notch punk. A\u0154ESI is no different, having already impressed with a few potted releases, and now a full(er)-length 12\u201d. A potent mix of rock\u2019n\u2019Oi! which has a nod to BLITZ and some of the more rockin\u2019 CROWN COURT tunes to boot(boy). It really is impressive to write such compelling sing-alongs in a language I can\u2019t speak, let alone shout along to. And yet I do. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bard\u00f8 Self Sabotage cassette Described as \u201cold fuckers on a PV bent,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what it is. Very raw-sounding, unpretentious powerviolence with obligatory intro samples. INFEST and NEANDERTHAL are high on their influences list, as they take some of their cues and use them to perfection. Old school to the core. What else to say? Let\u2019s fucking go! Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Rip Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Burgers Gone Wild / Dru the Drifter Do the Shplit! split cassette Following in the lineage of Jay Reatard and Drew Owen, DRU THE DRIFTER is a prolific young purveyor of lo-fi garagery, and the A-side of this tape showcases four new transmissions from this the incorrigible punk upstart. On the flip, BURGERS GONE WILD is a tambourine-shakin\u2019 one-man force to be reckoned with in the spirit of King Louie Bankston (R.I.P.) If you like it cheap and cheeky, you\u2019ll be rocking this one until you need a pencil to help spin its guts back inside. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Candy Snatchers Good Riddance / Round Up 7\u2033 Two new tracks of pure, unadulterated rock\u2019n\u2019roll from Virginia Beach\u2019s own CANDY SNATCHERS, now entering their thirty-third year of existence. What\u2019s left to say about a band that\u2019s been consistently active for the last three decades? Vocalist Larry May sounds like a combination of MEAT LOAF and Lux Interior of CRAMPS fame. May\u2019s range and energy is equal parts impressive and inspirational. Some folks begin phoning it all in after a measly ten years, but Larry\u2019s still out there spitting venom\u2014full of piss, vinegar, and Mountain Dew. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t talk about the music itself. This slab sounds fantastic; beautiful production and tight as hell. I\u2019m a tad shocked at how much I love this little piece of wax. Proof that punk can get better with age. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label I-94 Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Class Act Malaise LP CLASS ACT from Kansas City follows their debut tape with Malaise , a grimy and offbeat LP that toggles from full-speed West Coast-style hardcore punk to lumbering mid-tempo noise rock. There\u2019s offbeat, angular guitar work, some instrumental interludes, and vocals that gleefully rant and rave throughout. It\u2019s a frantic and at times chaotic listen; fans of MINUTEMEN and SACCHARINE TRUST will find lots to love here.

There\u2019s an aural alchemy in McCraven\u2019s post-production wizardry, the fervent compositions feeling like fresh studio iterations as much as previous live experiences culled from the archives; each set uniquely featuring a different live lineup with plenty of the musician\u2019s collaborators and International Anthem labelmates.

Add to that the multifarious contributions of MJ Lenderman, playing drums, bass, electric guitar and 12-string, and Megafaun\u2019s Brad Cook (bass, drums, recording and engineering), and you get an extraordinary debut record, wry and self-lacerating in parts and kick-down-the-amps rowdy in others. Wouter Dewit :: Still Posted on November 25, 2025 November 24, 2025 Via Hasselt, Belgium. These fleeting weeks between Halloween and Christmas, when the polyester cobwebs on the front porch are swapped out for tinsel garland, have no time to stake out their own identity. They\u2019re forever lost in transit from one holiday to the next. But during these ephemeral days between \u201cThe Monster Mash\u201d and \u201cSilver Bells,\u201d an album like Wouter Dewit\u2019s Still (2017) finds its place, mirroring the shift in seasons \u2014and in ourselves\u2014with bittersweet introspection. Dollar Diamonds :: Volume Three Posted on November 24, 2025 November 24, 2025 There\u2019s a lot of great records out there that can still be had for very little money. You just have to crouch down and give them a chance. How is it possible that these 2-sided slices of the human spirit can exist among us, in some cases, for over 50 years and still only be $1? Welcome to Dollar Diamonds, Volume 3. This month: Jesse Winchester, Eric Andersen, Neil Diamond, Doug Kershaw, Graham Parker, Tom T. Hall, and Robert Palmer\u2026 Paul McCartney & Wings :: Loup (1st Indian On The Moon) Posted on November 24, 2025 November 23, 2025 With a new oral history providing fascinating context on the self-proclaimed \u201cmadcap\u201d formation and career of Wings (a good chunk of which comes from Paul McCartney himself), spacey instrumental \u201cLoup (1st Indian On The Moon)\u201d has proven worthy of a closer listen. The deep cut oddity from 1973\u2019s oft-maligned Red Rose Speedway is an experimental studio piece featuring Minimoog synthesizer and plays out like a mini-prog opus, a little reminiscent of a Pink Floyd soundtrack cut. \u201cHard to explain\u201d, in the musician\u2019s own assessment. Happy Thanksgiving :: Doug Sahm And Friends \u2013 Austin, TX 1972 Posted on November 23, 2025 November 23, 2025 Tradition runs rampant around Thanksgiving: generations of old recipes, football, Alice\u2019s Restaurant, and, of course, a parade of balloons shutting down NYC. What else do you need? If you thought you were covered in the Thanksgiving tradition department, we did too\u2026until a few years ago, when someone blew the dust off a long lost tape \u2014 Doug Sahm\u2019s Thanksgiving Jam. The Joys of Cookin\u2019: Tracks from Groove Merchant, 1971-1974 (A Mixtape) Posted on November 21, 2025 November 21, 2025 Founded in 1971, Sonny Lester\u2019s Groove Merchant label was pretty far removed from what was going on in jazz at the beginning of that decade. Fusion, black power, spiritual jazz and ECM were all happening elsewhere. Maybe that\u2019s what makes it so much fun. Groove Merchant was content to serve up sweaty, funky party jazz, brimming with flute blowouts, wicked guitar and miles of Hammond B3 soul. Thrown in some softcore cover art, and you\u2019ve got something cooking. Lester\u2019s short-lived label had grooves to spare. Call it a case of truth in advertising. Sessa :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on November 20, 2025 November 20, 2025 On the eve of releasing his third album Sergio Sayeg, aka Sessa, is finally feeling comfortable with the idea that this is what he does for a living. But it\u2019s more complicated than that. He\u2019s a Brazilian musician recording modern Brazilian music with strong vintage references for an American indie label. He\u2019s one in a long line of Brazilian musicians with international audiences. With the birth of his son in 2022, he\u2019s also a father and his priorities have flipped, challenging him to find new ways to tap into his creativity and grow as a musician while supporting a family. We catch up with Sergio to discuss the way Pequena Vertigem de Amor sounds different from his previous albums, from the instrumentation to the vocals and why he thinks it\u2019s his best album yet. Matt LaJoie :: Stonehouse Posted on November 20, 2025 November 19, 2025 Ambient guitar mage and Flower Room Records impresario Matt LaJoie returns with the sprawling Stonehouse , a voyage to the far reaches of kosmische innerspace by way of midcoast Maine. While LaJoie\u2019s Ayurveda-rooted \u201celements cycle\u201d emanated a mellow bliss, Stonehouse and the corresponding tour document, Hiawatha Service , mark both an evolution and fruition of LaJoie\u2019s ever-expanding sonic vision and incorporates the heavier leanings of his days with northeast psychedelic jammers Herbcraft and the dub-inflected soundscapes released under his ML Wah moniker. Sonic Youth :: Washing Machine at 30 Posted on November 19, 2025 November 19, 2025 Three decades in, Washing Machine now feels like the most clear divide between the first and second halves of Sonic Youth\u2019s career. It finds a path forward that Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star seemed to be flailing for but just missing, and it would prepare the way for the albums A Thousand Leaves and Murray Street in particular.  And 30 years onward, it\u2019s an album that makes for an insightful Polaroid of the band at that fiery transitional moment. Lee Ranaldo shouts \u201cHello, 2015!\u201d at the end of \u201cSkip Tracer,\u201d but while the band itself would no longer exist when that year came around, Washing Machine was only continuing to grow into itself. Transmissions :: Kate Pierson (The B-52s) Posted on November 19, 2025 November 19, 2025 This week on Transmissions, Kate Pierson, vocalist and keyboardist of The B-52s. Writing about the legendary Athens band, AD founder Justin Gage says, \u201cThe B-52\u2019s 1979 debut album ushered in a practically fully formed sound/band. No one else was doing this\u2026whatever \u2018this\u2019 was.\u201d\u00a0Pierson joins us to discuss the band\u2019s history, Yoko Ono, her time with Julee Cruise, and much more. Miles in \u201865: The Journey to the Plugged Nickel Posted on November 18, 2025 November 18, 2025 1965 could\u2019ve easily been the end of the road for Miles Davis. Having spent much of the year laid up in a NY hospital, he returned to the stage with a quintet whose virtuosity had grown formulaic. En route to a two-week run at Chicago\u2019s Plugged Nickel, drummer Tony Williams hatched a plan for a renewed language. \u201cWhat if we made anti-music ?\u201d The results, documented on the newly reissued Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel , changed the landscape of modern jazz. Yesternow: Editor\u2019s Note Volume Six Posted on November 18, 2025 November 18, 2025 Jet lag edition. In this installment: Three nights of Radiohead in Madrid. Digging for records in London.

Steve Tibbetts :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on November 18, 2025 November 18, 2025 Close , guitarist Steve Tibbetts  latest album, might be his most rewardingly mysterious yet.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
