Please? Exitus Triumphalis Svntarer Some paths we don\u2019t choose in life we find ourselves walking down, nonetheless. These frigid, black trails are representative of the bleaker side of life. Whether what you feel is anger, despair, or horror, these feelings are alive in you, and you can use them to motivate you through dark times, or succumb to the darkness. That is the takeaway I have from the album. Der Torv Moeter Hav Heimland This wasn\u2019t a bad album per se, and the meaty bass notes were one of its best features. Unfortunately, it just sounded too much like FWOBM inspired music for me, and it wasn\u2019t diverse enough to really get off the ground. Cycle of the Dying Sun (Dawn of Ashen Realms) Runemagick Overall, this wasn\u2019t a bad album by any stretch, it just didn\u2019t challenge me much as a listener. Many of the songs had a similar sound and the slow pace didn\u2019t combine well with the somewhat bland riffs. Lore Cultic Cultic,\u00a0the newest album from the Pennsylvania extreme metal band,\u00a0Lore is definitely a strange and different [\u2026] Leo Rising Danko Jones Formed in 1996 Danko Jones hail from Ontario Canada.Over their nearly 30 year history the [\u2026] Shady Side Of Town EP Electric Boys The Electric Boys from Stockholm Sweden were formed in 1988,a band who\u2019s roots are 70\u2019s [\u2026] Set The Dark On Fire Edenbridge I am hesitant to call \"Set The Dark On Fire\" their best album ever, but it just might be. Poems of Spellcraft Draculum Each of the six tracks is a bit of mystery, beckoning the listener to unravel them. Signposted by year, the titles hint at a possible unified narrative if not by characters than at least by theme. Light and Desolation Blizaro Light and Desolation,\u00a0the newest album from doom metal band\u00a0Blizaro,\u00a0is nothing short of weird and bizarre, [\u2026] Dismal Thoughts Abysmal Descent \u201cDismal Thoughts\u201d goes beyond traditional Death Metal; it smartly blends Death Metal with Doom Metal and progressive elements The Second Death Katakomba \u201cThe Second Death\u201d delivers traditional Swedish Death Metal sound with modern elements. The album has pace, rawness, aggression, devastating chainsaw guitars, and a blood-freezing melodic framework Legends Sabaton There is not one wrong note on this album. All the songs are well balanced, very easy for the ears and most of all, of a very high quality. I can only applaud what I hear on \u201cLegends\u201d, as SABATON have once again given you a completely finished product that is ready to be admired. Built To Destroy N.Y.C. It is clear for me that N.Y.C. comes over a lot stronger, makes a lot better impression when they play loud and straight ahead. That\u2019s when the class and their experience shows itself, when they really have an impact with \u201cBuilt To Destroy\u201d. Burning Death Burning Death BURNING DEATH might be the band to reach superstar status, but as long as they\u2019re around they\u2019re bringing us as listeners a lot of pleasure with \u201cBurning Death\u201d. Black Widow Nebula Caelestra Synths kept a steady presence throughout, sometimes rising with a fist and other times settling back in the shadows, but they were always knocking. Harsh vocals brought a measure of hard truth to the album, while cleans kept things pristine at times. It was the way these things were combined into a seasoned stew that made for such an an excellent listening experience. Rat City Rockers Casket Rats Casket Rats are a a gritty,no nonsense,analog focused Hard Rock.The band deliver raw,street fighting,unapologetic rock [\u2026] Shadows Of The Dying Light Sarayasign Sarayasign return with \"Shadows Of The Dying Light\", their most ambitious release yet\u2014a sweeping, cinematic [\u2026] Malicious Spears Archaic Thorn Ahh. Hand-drawn cover art. It's nice to see. Precipice Lychgate A precipice is the edge of a very steep cliff, and that\u2019s what I felt the entire time...standing so close to death. This was a pleasantly strange, unsettling listening experience for me, and the closest feeling that I can think of to describing it might be either the liberation, or the horrible guilt, one feels when they have just taken the soul from a fellow human. S\u00f3 Quem Viu o Rel\u00e2mpago \u00e0 Sua Direita Sabe Kaatayra After two listens, I am still not entirely sure what I think about the album. The band leaves the door open for mystery, and even your own imagination. Harsh vocals contrast with traditional Brazilian folk music in a way that just keeps you on your toes throughout the experience, and if nothing else, its mysteries are buried deep within. The Wild Card Treat The songs themselves are simple and straight forward, they just come to the point. If you are looking for intricate structures, for different sorts of breaks and/or all kinds of variety in a song, forget it. If you want all those ingredients throughout the record, you are in for a TREAT, as \u201cThe Wild Card\u201d has all that in spades. A Test Of Strength Zero Tolerance A Test Of Strength\u201d is a solid, decent but also extremely entertaining album. I doubt that ZERO TOLERANCE will achieve world dominance with this album but I am sure that they are going to gain a lot of praise from a lot of Thrash and Heavy Metal fans. The Carcass Choir Monachopsis \"A techdeathmess from the midlands,\" you say... Canvas Mors Verum When I hear the term Death Metal, I get images of rotting flesh, destruction and death, and even guttural noise. But here, the music was alive\u2026moving, breathing, never standing still. It\u2019s ardent enough for the common fan, but also offers a kaleidoscope of other sounds for those of us looking for something different. De l'Ab\u00eeme au Pl\u00e9r\u00f4me Sanctvs Overall, this was a solid album to listen to. It didn\u2019t necessarily offer anything new to the genre, but you can hear the fire and the passion behind the compositions, as well as the artist\u2019s skills. The Lamentations Forever Autumn \u201cThe Lamentations\u201d is Autumn Ni Dubhghaill\u2019s most stirring release to date, and not just in the emotional or sentimental sense but in a raw and visceral sense as well. Aus uralter Zeit XIV Dark Centuries Five years has been a bit of a wait but then again, the band does measure itself in centuries so I guess I can\u2019t really complain. Tears Sacrifice If you ask me, this Japanese version of SACRIFICE should have been at least as big worldwide as the Canadian Thrash Metal band with the same name. There can\u2019t be any doubt at all that these guys were capable of writing and recording bloody good music. On \u201cTears\u201d that gives us over 44 minutes of beautiful Heavy Metal. Heed The Prophecy (Reissue) Paragon PARAGON is an American band from Springfield in Ohio. These guys only existed from 1987 until 1992/1993, of that no one is exactly sure. In those times they played pure Melodic Progressive US Metal. Apparently, they wanted to sound like some of the big US Progressive Metal bands. Free Fall War Grave The new record by London England thrash metal band\u00a0War Grave, Freewill,\u00a0is nothing short of an [\u2026] Fiery Path Infernal Presence \u201cFiery Path\u201d is traditional Black Metal with direct and punishing guitar riffs, aggressive growls, and blood-freezing melodies Last Light Fades Graves for Gods This was an excellent Doom album. For one, the band\u2019s vision was not just about long songs with slow, heavy beats, because they also added a flair for the psychedelic at times with lead notes, and even keys. This approach kept the dastardly depressing sound more active to the listener, and this is an album that all Doom fans should take a gander at. Let Water Flow Moon Wisdom Overall, this was a decent listening experience, but I just didn\u2019t get a firm enough handle on their sound through 30 minutes of runtime.

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

Nearly out of options, the crew risks it all in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life - one way or the other. 97 Metascore 11. Metroid Prime Nov 17, 2002 \u2022 Rated T Samus returns in a new mission to unravel the mystery behind the ruined walls scattered across Tallon IV. In Metroid Prime, you'll play the role of this bounty hunter and view the world through her visor, which displays information ranging from current energy levels to ammunition. Equipped with a Power Beam and Gravity Suit, you must shoot locked switches, solve puzzles, and eliminate enemies. It's up to you to explore the world and recover more power-ups and weapons, which gradually open more gameplay areas. 97 Metascore 12. Grand Theft Auto III Oct 22, 2001 \u2022 Rated M Players are put at the heart of their very own gangster movie, and let loose in a fully-realised 3 dimensional city with a cast of hundreds, 50 plus vehicles, ranging from sports cars to ice cream trucks and from boats to buses, 3 hours of music, including opera, reggae, house, drum and bass, pop and disco, and a huge array of street ready weapons.  [Rockstar Games] 97 Metascore 13. Super Mario Odyssey Oct 27, 2017 \u2022 Rated E10+ New Evolution of Mario Sandbox-Style Gameplay. Mario embarks on a new journey through unknown worlds, running and jumping through huge 3D worlds in the first sandbox-style Mario game since Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.

Halo: Combat Evolved Nov 15, 2001 \u2022 Rated M In a desperate attempt to keep a conquering alien race called the Covenant from finding Earth, you--a cybernteically enhanced soldier representing the peak of human military evolution--and a ragtag group of Marines flee to a distant uncharted system where you unexpectedly stumble across Halo, an enormous alien artifact in orbit between a gas giant and its moon. Your objective: Uncover Halo's horrible secret, and destroy mankind's nemesis - the Covenant. [Microsoft] 97 Metascore 15. NFL 2K1 Sep 7, 2000 \u2022 Rated E In the end, NFL 2K1 is a deeper, more refined version of the original game. 97 Metascore 16. Half-Life 2 Nov 16, 2004 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2004 PC Game of the Year]  By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- are counting on him. [Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience. After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture, a city hidden beneath the sea. Constructed as an idealistic society for a hand picked group of scientists, artists and industrialists, the idealism is no more. Now the city is littered with corpses, wildly powerful guardians roam the corridors as little girls loot the dead, and genetically mutated citizens ambush you at every turn. Take control of your world by hacking mechanical devices, commandeering security turrets and crafting unique items critical to your very survival. Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels, explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them? [2K Games] 96 Metascore 18. GoldenEye 007 Aug 25, 1997 \u2022 Rated T You are Bond. James Bond. You are assigned covert operations connected with the GoldenEye weapons satellite.

Down on his luck, Drake is lured back into the treacherous world of thieves and mercenary treasure-seekers he had sought to leave behind.

Caught in a web of deception and plunged into an increasingly deadly pursuit that tests the limits of his endurance, Drake will be forced to risk everything - but has his luck finally run out? [SCEA] 96 Metascore 20. Resident Evil 4 (2005) Jan 11, 2005 \u2022 Rated M Resident Evil 4 marks a new chapter in the Resident Evil series. You'll rejoin Leon S.

The Orange Box Oct 10, 2007 \u2022 Rated M Games included in The Orange Box compilation: The original Half-Life 2 - The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling.

The game's daring new art style features the most advanced graphics of any Source-based game released to date. [Valve Software] 96 Metascore 23.

The AMG Staff Pick Their Top Ten(ish) of 2025 By Steel Druhm on December 26, 2025 in Blog Posts , Lists , 336 comments The AMG Staff Lists are ready for review, examination, and ultimately, rejection. Have a Merry Little AMG Christmas and a Very Metal New Year By Steel Druhm on December 25, 2025 in Blog Posts , 67 comments Steel Druhm has yuletide wishes and graveside missives to impart on this special day. Record(s) o\u2019 the Month \u2013 November 2025 By Steel Druhm on December 24, 2025 in Record o' the Month , 91 comments The November Record(s) o\u2019 the Month have been sacked, racked, and shoved down your filthy chimney. Pray you left cookies and hobo wine out for AMG and Steel ! Amalekim \u2013 Shir Hashirim [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Baguette of Bodom on December 23, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Black Metal , Melodic Black Metal , 39 comments \u201cYou may be wondering what on earth I am doing willingly touching a black metal album, let alone complimenting one. Well, you know what they say: never let them know your next move. Mysterious Polish-Italian collective Amalekim garnered praise in these hallowed halls with their 2023 release Avodah Zarah , our own Thus Spoke calling it a highlight during a weaker year for the genre. Naturally, I disliked the album, which tends to be a good sign for the average black metal fan. I was nevertheless surprised to see Shir Hashirim released to little fanfare or label promotion after such a positive reception 18 months prior.\u201d Pole vaulting. Species \u2013 Changelings [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Grin Reaper on December 23, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Thrash Metal , 42 comments \u201cAbout once a year, I find a technical thrash album I utterly adore. 2023 graced me with Xoth , and 2024\u2019s Dissimulator debut was my favorite album of the year. In 2025, the premiere thrash platter belongs to Warsaw, Poland\u2019s Species . Unfairly or not, thrash is an oft-maligned genre accused of being unserious and trite or stale and stuck in the past. On Changelings , Species \u2019 sophomore offering, the band nimbly threads the needle between paying homage to thrash\u2019s heyday while shaping a fresh sound that\u2019s enchanting yet familiar.\u201d Speed into the future. Panopticon \u2013 Songs of Hiraeth [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Thus Spoke on December 22, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Atmospheric Black Metal , Black Metal , Folk , 19 comments \u201cI spent so long this summer submerged in Panopticon \u2019s discography, once I came back up, I was overwhelmed by the amount of things I\u2019d missed or needed to get a headstart on. Consequently, I didn\u2019t spend a huge amount of time with Songs of Hiraeth when it first dropped; I listened, loved it, made a note to TYMHM it, and moved on. It was only as Autumn started to turn into Winter and the seasonal chill reminded me of not just my end-of-year writing obligations, but the snowy wildernesses of Northern America (and Northern Europe, where much of Songs of Hiraeth was conceived).\u201d Calls of the wild. Starscourge \u2013 Conqueror of the Stars \u2013 Betwixt Sundered Seraphim, the Lands Between Bleed Review By Andy-War-Hall on December 22, 2025 in Reviews , Blackened Death Metal , 49 comments \u201cFromsoftware\u2019s behemoth action-RPG Elden Ring is an enigma. How a game so obtuse, difficult, and uniquely itself in its visuals and storytelling became the blockbuster that it is baffles me, and it\u2019s one of those precious pieces of art that simply makes me happy to live in the same world as it. It\u2019s also metal as anything can be. Bands like Fell Omen have tapped into the game\u2019s mythology for inspiration before and, now, the international blackened death duo Starscourge enter the fray with their debut Conqueror of the Stars \u2013 Betwixt Sundered Seraphim, the Lands Between Bleed .\u201d Star power. Sallow Moth \u2013 Mossbane Lantern [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Grin Reaper on December 21, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Death Metal , 27 comments \u201cI don\u2019t know if Garry Brents is the busiest person in metal, but he\u2019s active enough that I worry for his work-life balance. In 2025 alone, Brents cranked out releases for multiple projects, including Sallow Moth \u2019s latest platter, Mossbane Lantern . This is death metal for purveyors of the unrepentantly weird, especially those who indulge in sci-fi and fantasy.\u201d Leave the lantern on. Moron Police \u2013 Pachinko [Things you Might have Missed 2025] By GardensTale on December 21, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed , Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Progressive Rock , 71 comments \u201c Moron Police is an odd band, if the moniker didn\u2019t give it away. The first few albums were very comedy-oriented, but A Boat on the Sea suddenly saw the band tackling anti-war themes, without giving up the bright melodic sound that draws from progressive rock and anime soundtrack J-rock alike. Production on Pachinko was already on the way when drummer Thore Pettersen died in a car accident. After taking the time to mourn their friend, Moron Police soldiered on, aided by Dillinger Escape Plan drummer Billy Rymer. The result is an astounding album in every regard, an experience unlike anything I\u2019ve heard in years.\u201d Required by law. Dagdr\u00c3\u00b8m \u2013 Schauder [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Kenstrosity on December 20, 2025 in Reviews , Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Black Metal , Melodic Black Metal , 17 comments \u201cTo be perfectly honest, I no longer recall when or how exactly I encountered Germany\u2019s Dagdr\u00c3\u00b8m for the first time. There\u2019s a pretty good chance it was a Discordian recommendation, or I discovered it organically while sifting through Bandcamp\u2019s new releases feed. Either way, their debut Schauder regularly circulates on my listening rotation. Weirdly, it received very little fanfare from the commenters or other arenas of metallic discourse that I frequent. It\u2019s a shame, because Schauder remains one of the coolest melodic black metal albums released this year.\u201d D\u00c3\u00b8gg\u00c3\u00b8ne it!

Maximum Rocknroll wants to review everything that comes out in the world of underground punk rock, hardcore, garage, post-punk, thrash, etc. No major labels or labels exclusively distributed by major-owned distributors, no reviews of test pressings or promo CDs without final artwork. We reserve the right to reject releases on the basis of content. Music without vocals or drums will not be considered. All music submitted for review must have been released (or reissued) within the last two years. Please include contact information and let us know where your band is from! Angel Face Out in the Street LP If you\u2019re a fan of garage punk and this isn\u2019t already on your radar, then no, you\u2019re not. Distributed via the gold standard Slovenly and featuring members of TEENGENERATE and the FADEAWAYS, this exemplifies what makes the genre exciting. The hooks are incredible and the production presents the whole affair within crackling gritty trappings. These players have power pop chops for decades, but they\u2019re so tuned in here and pushed into the red that they have major teeth track to track. Background \u201cooh\u201ds and \u201cahh\u201ds are guiding stars of style, as well as handclaps that inflect a bubblegum tone that bumps nicely against the spikier edges of what\u2019s going on. This group\u2019s debut was good stuff, but this is a whole other level. The B-side standout \u201cPress Your Luck\u201d has STOOGES\u2019 dripping venom with a chorus that\u2019s downright gorgeous. The album is undeniable, so don\u2019t try and fight it off and let it take over your turntable. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Slovenly Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Banda Des Femer Her\u00e8ncia Enverinada 12\u2033 It\u2019s the first time I get assigned a band singing in Menorcan Catalan, which is a specific type of Catalan from the Balearic Islands, and if the language is new to me, the music certainly is not, because BANDA DES FEMER play good old raw, k\u00e4ng-influenced hardcore punk that takes no prisoners and gets straight to the point. What sets this LP apart might be the peculiar production that keeps things deceptively simple and primitive\u2014it doesn\u2019t go for any deafening \u201cwall of noise\u201d or anything fancy, but just old school D-beat punk for the punks (a noble cause indeed). The band clearly displays self-awareness about the genre and their own technical prowess, which I find quite refreshing. I like the upfront vocals that are still intelligible, and there are some welcome mid-paced moments and even a couple of sing-alongs. There are strong hints of \u201990s D-beat and some songs would have been at home on a Distortion Records compilation in 1994. The music also reminds me of DHK for its spontaneity and its radicalism, not synonymous with extremity here but of core value. Simple, fast, and loud political hardcore punk that loves DISCHARGE lovers. However, I think the record should have been longer, as seven songs in fourteen minutes is a little short for an album (although the three members do not live in the same town, so practicing has to be an issue), but these are fourteen good minutes. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Diy Kontraatak / Korc Edicions / Plastic Wound / Todo Roto / Wrong Disk / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 [Brick] Demo 2025 cassette Visceral and vitriolic, the UK\u2019s [BRICK] are angry and have good reason to be. Existing in a world that rejects you at every turn is unimaginable, but that is indeed their reality. As a group of trans women (who met at a transfeminist book club, awesome), [BRICK]\u2019s songs speak to the very real hate faced by trans people every day. Sonically, it\u2019s a lo-fi and straightforward punk affair, occasionally going off the rails into discordant noise territory. Lyrically, it\u2019s a brutal listen, but one that deserves to be heard. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Covids Pay No Mind LP The COVIDS have an UNDERTONES quality to their songs while drawing in a more modern song structure influenced by Goner Records\u2019 roster of catchier bands, the Rev. N\u00f8rb, and bands blending the METHADONES and RAMONES. \u201cWaste of Space\u201d is my favorite track on the record simply because of the way they cadence the chorus of \u201cspace and time\u201d with space and time; it will make sense when you hear it. There are ten songs rounding out this LP, making this a perfect length. I think I\u2019m most pleased by the front and back of the sleeve because it gives you a near-perfect idea of what this band is like just by the color and composition, and the sunglasses on the back made me giggle. Reviewer Tony Party Label Wap Shoo Wap Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Drags Dragsploitation\u2026 Now! LP One of three well-deserved DRAGS reissues delivered by Total Punk this year, Dragsploitation\u2026 Now! is a brief and potent ride through the band\u2019s legendary \u201960s-fueled punk swagger in its earlier stages. Originally released as a 10\u201d by Estrus in 1995, this was their sophomore effort following the iconic I Like to Die 7\u201d. Alongside the MAKERS, THEE HEADCOATS, and a handful of others, these guys forged the throwback garage style of the \u201990s, offering an eye-opening take on punk for impressionable youth of that era (including yours truly.) Dig that crazy beat\u2014it still feels fresh 30 years later. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Total Punk Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Endless Joy Endless Joy LP Iron Lung hits the mark once again, delivering another masterclass in abrasive, high-stakes hardcore. ENDLESS JOY plays with tension and dissonance like a weapon\u2014jagged riffs, frantic delivery, and a suffocating, anxious energy that never lets up. Every song feels like it\u2019s on the verge of imploding, yet the band maintains complete control, which is exactly what makes it so powerful. Easily one of the strongest releases of the batch. Iron Lung no falla, y este LP es otra prueba de su punter\u00eda quir\u00fargica. ENDLESS JOY ejecuta un hardcore desquiciado, tenso y abrasivo, donde la disonancia funciona como motor emocional. Los temas avanzan como un enjambre el\u00e9ctrico: r\u00e1pidos, inc\u00f3modos y llenos de esquinas filosas. Todo suena al borde del colapso pero siempre bajo control, lo que lo vuelve a\u00fan m\u00e1s poderoso. Uno de los discos m\u00e1s fuertes del mes. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Fuzz Bombers The Fuzz Bombers cassette reissue The FUZZ BOMBERS were a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-them San Gabriel Valley band active circa 1998, built from ex-members of the JAWAS and future members of the TAKEDOWNS and BAD MOTIVATOR, among others\u2014basically the extended universe of singer/label-runner Brian Von Wolfe. This tape pulls together two sessions from that year, and the results are classic no-budget garage punk: fast, loose, and sounding slightly better than recorded-on-a-boombox. There\u2019s an early version of \u201cGet Out Of,\u201d later re-recorded by the TAKEDOWNS, but this one is faster and a shade more raw. None of this rewrites the genre playbook, but it\u2019s a perfectly decent document of late-\u201990s punk ephemera. Maybe essential if you\u2019re trying to fill out the Brian-adjacent family tree; otherwise, it\u2019s probably not going to have a huge impact on anybody. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Wolf on a Bridge Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 High Anxiety Your Dreams Are Caught in War 12\u2033 HIGH ANXIETY from Ontario, Canada plays crust-blown anarcho-punk, and earlier this year, they released Your Dreams Are Caught in War , which is ten tracks of indignation and rage. Espousing post-crust and proto-grind elements, HIGH ANXIETY features noisy vocals, upfront, dirty bass, and guitar riffs that are primitive, rhythmic, and energetic. Lyrically, HIGH ANXIETY cuts through the bullshit with scathing criticisms of political, cultural, and religious institutions of our time. The ten songs on this disc are over in much too short of an amount of time, leading to multiple playthroughs. Your Dreams are Caught in War is a joint release of Fiadh Productions and Violet Hour Transmissions, so the sleeve and disc are of the highest quality. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Fiadh Productions / Violet Hour Transmissions Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Icks Devil cassette Second five-song cassette released by this Florida three-piece punk outfit. Similar to the first tape, this follow-up is almost painfully lo-fi. Unfortunately, this does detract a bit from the songs, making it difficult to discern exactly what\u2019s going on. While I find the attempt to do an analog recording right onto a stereo tape deck incredibly commendable (and a hell of a lot more real than doing a crummy cell-phone-recorded demo), there is a learning curve and obvious limitations with such an approach. In terms of the songs themselves, the first three are driving, mid-tempo grunge-inspired punk songs with somewhat lazy vocal delivery, \u201cNice Things\u201d being the clear standout of the bunch. From here, the tape changes lanes completely, bringing us an artistic, quirky spoken word/bass interlude, and finally an acoustic, open-mic-style bedroom pop song. All in all, I\u2019m just left more confused than anything else after listening to this release. Oh, also, having to do research to figure out that a release is on a tape label is a bizarre move. Why wouldn\u2019t the label releasing something just put their label name somewhere on the tape or the artwork? Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Ragdoll Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Jailcell Recipes Artifact for an Empty Tank World LP A reissue compilation encompassing the first two full-lengths and first two EPs from hardcore Wiganers JAILCELL RECIPES. The target for this collection was to clean up poor-quality old recordings to be introduced amongst a teeming new audience. Did it work? Yes, it did. The traversing collection starts with the band in their heavily YOUTH OF TODAY-influenced genesis and ends with the band\u2019s LEATHERFACE-styled coda. Tons of material is crammed into this record sleeve, really everything there could be to know about these blokes. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label First Strike Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Knotwork Knotwork demo cassette The last time I heard of a Detroit crust band was when ANGUISH released their first EP in 2009, a comparatively innocent time when the very idea of Donald Trump being president still belonged to the realm of dystopian science fiction (where it should have stayed). I cannot be said to have a large expertise in this area, but I have a\u00a0 sixth sense when it comes to quality crust and, weather permitting, am able to detect it from beyond the seas. KNOTWORK had been on my prestigious \u201cbands to watch for\u201d list, so I was genuinely excited when this demo tape finally came out. And let me tell you that I was right to be excited, and my sixth sense is as sharp as ever. If the production might be a little too raw for some\u2014as a lover of cave music, it certainly is not for me\u2014the songwriting skills of KNOTWORK are undeniable, and for a first proper recording, it is a crust tour de force. The band inhabits the stenchcore revival waters of the punk world and are not unlike modern classic bands like ALEMENT, the sadly missed ZYGOME or mid/late \u201900s INSTINCT OF SURVIVAL, meaning they have a certain flair for good crust arrangements. Basically, they keep working on the traditional old school apocalyptic metal crust sound that, if it cannot be said to be the fanciest of punk subgenres these days, still has very loyal enthusiasts ready to save on soap in order to buy the stenchcore goods. KNOTWORK also nods to the genre\u2019s forefathers like DEVIATED INSTINCT or AXEGRINDER on a couple of occasions, but the influences are overall structural, the band cannot be considered as too derivative even if they borrow liberally. There is a good mix of paces and vocal styles, which is all the more impressive since there is just one vocalist who can switch from demonic growls \u00e0 la LAST LEGION ALIVE to more traditional DETESTATION-ish \u201990s anarcho shouts. This tape is right up crust street. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Distorted Sedition / Sound of Chaos Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Laundry Bats Hangin on a String LP Behold the LAUNDRY BATS\u2014an unanticipated bastion of punk purity in these troubled times. These are the Memphis all-stars of dirt-caked rock\u2019n\u2019roll, featuring members of the OBLIVIANS and COMPULSIVE GAMBLERS, and led by the distinctly raw vocals of Abe White (MANATEEES, TRUE SONS OF THUNDER). This configuration taps into an unbridled, freewheeling spirit that unwittingly touches edges with the likes of the RETAIL SIMPS and even Bloomington\u2019s enigmatic COWBOYS, swinging from soulful \u201970s blues rock \u00e0 la Kill City (\u201cBizness\u201d) to psychedelic spaghetti western (\u201cLawnmower Man\u201d) in impressively graceful fashion. You\u2019ll throw your hands in the air at the haunting and sympathetic \u201cChurch of Bad,\u201d and nod in approval as \u201cNightmare\u201d reappropriates the lead riff from the CLASH\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s My Name\u201d like it was a stolen catalytic converter welded onto a rusted Camaro. That\u2019s not the only familiar groove you\u2019ll find here, but any similarities to other songs living or dead are undoubtedly in tasteful homage. It\u2019s a diversely inspired party of a record, with the only constant being that it\u2019s 100% fire. Reviewer Jason Harding Label HoZac Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Lo and Behold Onward Journey cassette Debut release from LO AND BEHOLD, the solo project of Louis Harding. In a list of bands too long to name, Harding\u2019s tenure as a songwriter really shines through on this heartfelt, ten-track masterpiece. I recognized his name from his bass work in BELGRADO, whose 2023 Intra Apogeum made quite a splash. That said, there\u2019s no synth/dance vibe present on Onward Journey , instead we get a beautiful, sweeping reverie, reminiscent of the shimmering guitar and despair on something like Paul Westerberg\u2019s \u201cAnswering Machine\u201d\u2014trading Midwestern sensibilities for downcast British shoe-scuffing. This will make my top ten albums of the year, easy. I just hope the cassettes are quality, because unlike many raucous, lo-fi recordings, this one wants to be listened to loud and clear. Buy the ticket, take the Journey . Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Gob Nation / Inscrutable Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Manks Last New Wave Hero!!!!!! CD Japan\u2019s the MANKS ran from 1994\u20132001 as part of the Chiba punk scene, and Last New Wave Hero!!!!!!! collects eight tracks of their extremely lo-fi garage/\u201977-style punk, pulled from demos and compilation appearances recorded thirty years ago. It\u2019s raw, unvarnished, recorded-in-the-basement rock delivered with a bratty, high-energy sneer. \u201cMy Generation\u201d might be the highlight for me, although at 2:52, it\u2019s the longest song on the collection and probably could\u2019ve been trimmed. It all falls into that wonderfully sloppy zone where there\u2019s way more spirit than technical finesse, but I think the potential really shines through. Members later went on to the SPIT, the PLASTERS, and, more recently, SPIT-TN, but this CD captures the scrappy origin point and it\u2019s better than it has any right to be. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Private Scandal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Optic Sink Lucky Number LP Tennessee\u2019s OPTIC SINK delivers eight synth-driven post-punk tracks with their LP Lucky Number . While thoughtfully layered drum machine beats and bass lines akin to Peter Hook\u2019s melodic style form a strong foundation for the album, analog and unpolished synth tracks provide a nice, gritty top layer for Natalie Hoffmann of NOTS to sing over. Though not as front and center, guitars help strengthen the melodic content significantly. All in all, it\u2019s a nice album to sway along and wander off. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label Feel It Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dre Perish Criminal Ghost LP Rootsy collection of noisy, melodic rock songs steeped in Southern gothic and reverb that might appeal to fans of the GUN CLUB or the DRIN. Criminal Ghost is not bad by any means, but it definitely follows a more traditionally structured mainstream rock music approach than punk, although some of these tracks do have a smoky post-punk skeleton inside the meticulous production. DRE has a full-throated singing voice with a bluesy warble that registers somewhere between Win Butler of the ARCADE FIRE and Jeffrey Lee Pierce and gives the songs a lived-in sonic weight. The recording was done in New Orleans, which seems apropos, given the streetwalking at dusk vibes; I can practically smell the stale beer and cigarette smoke wafting through the lyrics, accompanied with just a touch of danger. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Strange Daisy Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Pocket Bike Racers Pocket Bike Racers demo cassette Posthumous cassette release of a two-song demo from a lo-fi, nasty, rock\u2019n\u2019roll/rockabilly-infused one-off garage punk project from Cleveland, OH, recorded in 2020 during COVID lockdown. There\u2019s something very charming about these tracks, and it is yet another of many examples from that timeframe of people finding a way to have some sort of creative outlet when isolated from others. Released in small quantities, Knuckles On Stun is onto their second run of 25 copies of this demo, with the second press having the art inverted as a differentiation from the first run of 25. Thankfully, my copy is from the first run or I would have had to photocopy my own cover, inverting it back to normal as that is a massive pet peeve of mine. Check out the recent article written for The Counterforce on that exact topic if you are confused as to what I mean. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Schenectavoidz Attaining New Levels of High cassette Straight out of Schenectady, New York, this hometown homage brings us some modern \u201cblink it and you\u2019ll miss it\u201d hardcore. To put it bluntly (no pun intended), most of these tracks don\u2019t last longer than a minute-and-a-half, besides the appropriately titled \u201c90 Seconds\u201d which abandons the lightning-quick hardcore motif and adopts a sludgier edge. These folks channel the energy of CHARLES BRONSON, but sound a bit more like fellow East Coasters EVERY TIME I DIE and SUCIDE FILE. If you\u2019re a fan of the modern hardcore sound of the last two decades, you\u2019re going to want to check this out. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Shock to the System Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Shakti Shakti LP Barcelona punk band with members of Indian heritage deliver a fucking killer debut record that captures post-colonial disillusionment so precisely that it sounds like a future rebel anthem. With Marathi-language vocals and Bollywood-influenced dancefloor rhythms, SHAKTI feels culturally rooted in India, while also existing as a seething punk band. It\u2019s an incredible, invigorating balance\u2014and the track \u201cLahan Pani,\u201d with its spoken word intro detailing the exploitation of India by countries that repair the favor with blatant racism, is maybe the year\u2019s best album opener. The bass riff is hooky, and the fury that follows is decimating. Locked-in bass/drums configurations that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a disco floor abound on this record, but it stays punk AF; not an easy feat. Songs like \u201cMaut\u201d and \u201cAndolan\u201d have a funk-anchored post-punk approach that crackles with found-sound samples, sounding like a walk past a dance club anchored by a wall of TVs displaying the same staticky news reporter. It\u2019s a rich experience, and you owe it to yourself as a connoisseur of international punk to get this on your turntable fast. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label La Vida Es Un Mus Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 So Close / Wipeout split EP Samples and powerviolence go together like a horse and a carriage. WIPEOUT delivers a seriously bass-heavy axe to the face, with a thin, can-like snare cutting through the wall of fuzz with precision, and horrific vocals setting the mood. Four tracks of modern powerviolence as short as they come that could appease both the WEEKEND NACHOS enjoyer as well as the CROSSED OUT purist. Next up is SO CLOSE, and guess what? Samples? Check! Blasts, skanks, and breakdowns? Check! More polished-sounding (if there is such a thing), INFEST-like fast hardcore delivered with the obligatory Joe Denunzio snarl. And by the time you\u2019re done reading this review, so will be the split. One for the Ham-slappers. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Drinkin' Beer in Bandana Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Starburst Revolutionary Technology cassette Harkening back to when emo was being argued over on the WEEZER message boards (during its third wave that many decried as false) is this harsh-washed gem of a tape that buries its achingly sweet harmonies in swaths of lo-fi gunk. The result is totally compelling and well-anchored to its melodies, which are uniformly excellent. Even though they get a little Midwestern on the lick starting off the penultimate cut \u201cSummer,\u201d this is a novel approach to pop-sensible indie rock with a punk ethos. Perfecto. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Rip Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 V/A This Is It\u2026 LP With every compilation I have ever heard in my entire life, I always look for several distinct things. The first being, did these bands give their best, or did they submit throwaway tracks? Second, do I get the feeling that I\u2019d want to stop into this area for lunch and record shopping? Third, and most importantly, do I want to seek out music from bands I\u2019ve never heard before? Put simply, this is the Midwest at its absolute best, styled as a variety of underground hardcore and punk to let you know that quality control and intent is paramount to the label that put this out. With seven bands, and six of them having multiple songs, this comp does its best to hack a path to uncover that raw nerve dry socket of the Great Lakes region. The record comes hammering in with CROSSES, which is essentially DIE KREUZEN, and I don\u2019t want to waste the space telling you what you already know about the staggering power of their ferocious songwriting. Up next, SEX CHANGE comes blasting in, and reminds me of a RORSCHACH, ANTISCHISM, and DROPDEAD both in style and highly charged personal lyrics. MDOP\u2019s two songs are wall-of-sound hardcore, and the recording makes me think they left some blood on the floor in that room. They are a gross rainbow of chaos and corrosive juices playing completely unhinged hardcore. The lyrics \u201cFuck this job, kill your boss,\u201d come on, who can\u2019t get behind that? KIWI ARMY brings in pop punk/power pop with melody and a homage to one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time, Silent Night Deadly Night . Similarly to how DESCENDENTS deliver an amount of level-setting to an SST compilation, KIWI ARMY mirrors that with their style of melodic punk songwriting\u2014what I mean by this is having great musicians pull in a perspective outside of aggressive id, and harnessing an everyday joy or sarcasm to round out the Side A. However, KIWI ARMY\u2019s second tune abandons the poppier punk elements with a straightforward song called \u201cThe Boring Song,\u201d and it will burrow its way into your brain and live there for the rest of your life, methinks. NO SYMPATICO might be my favorite band on here, featuring members of THEE ELDER GODS and channeling NOMEANSNO and CRUCIFUCKS while allowing ample space to be themselves. The songs mirror driving a big-engined car with a middle finger out the window, slowing down for raccoons and opossums, but heavy-footed through tweed and suit and uniform and meat and fat and muscle of certain people. PIG RIDES have members of a ton of bands you\u2019ve passed up in dollar bins or who were featured on the split 7\u201d that you bought for the other band\u2014here is your chance to hear what they\u2019ve become, and it is worth it. You get two dense hardcore songs delivered in the NEGATIVE APPROACH style of Midwestern hardcore you\u2019ve come to love. To be honest, when I heard these tracks, I pulled the needle off the record, looked them up, and ordered their cassette on December 4th, 2025 at 11:21 PM. Closing this record out is the STATE. The STATE is Michigan\u2019s longest-running hardcore band, with Jeff Bale having reviewed their No Illusions EP in Maximum Rocknroll #10 in 1983, to now, me, Maximum Rocknroll #511, in 2025. Here is the good and bad about that, nothing has changed. The STATE is still ferocious and machine-faultless in delivery. This makes for great songs with impact, but it also makes me a little bit sad that 42 years later, things are still the way they are. This compilation overwhelmingly succeeded in overcoming all three measurable points I have. I do have one challenge with this record, and it is kind of a big one for me\u2014no booklet. The insert doesn\u2019t match the power or intent of the music, and to me, it softens the full force a bit. I really love to read along with bands, and without that, I can only be partially committed. A corrective suggestion might be to have the bands send in something and plop a link to a downloadable PDF on the Bandcamp page. I dunno, I\u2019m spitballin\u2019 here. In the end, this is a fucking outstanding representation of current Middle West bands, and you\u2019d be foolish to let this pass. Reviewer Tony Party Label Back Ache Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Axe Collector Unforced Damage EP Human Future continues to prove why they\u2019re one of the most exciting labels in today\u2019s hardcore landscape. Evil-driven AXE COLLECTOR unleashes a full-force EP of ripping, steel-cut aggression: sharp riffs, collapsing-wall drums, and vocals that spit fire without a pause. Every track hits like a thrown brick\u2014fast, raw, and absolutely determined. Fury with intention, nothing sloppy, all deadly precise. Hardcore with no filler, no posturing. A record that feels urgent, necessary, alive, like it was tracked inside a street riot. One of my favorites this month. Human Future contin\u00faa demostrando por qu\u00e9 es uno de los sellos m\u00e1s emocionantes del circuito hardcore actual. Guiados por una fuerza maligna, AXE COLLECTOR entrega un EP que es pura metralla: riffs filosos, bater\u00edas que parecen detonar paredes y una voz que te escupe la realidad sin descanso. Cada tema cae como un ladrillazo\u2014r\u00e1pido, crudo, decidido. Hay furia, pero tambi\u00e9n claridad en la ejecuci\u00f3n, nada suena atolondrado, todo est\u00e1 apuntado a matar. Hardcore sin relleno, sin poses, sin descanso. Un disco que se siente urgente y necesario, como si estuviese grabado en medio de un incendio en una manifestaci\u00f3n. Uno de mis favoritos del mes. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Extinction Burst / Human Future Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Ayucaba Operaci\u00f3n Masacre LP Here\u2019s a searing debut from this Barcelona powerhouse. Featuring members of killer bands like MURO and INYECCION, the bar for this slab is quite high, but goddamn, my expectations were fully exceeded. Not unlike INYECCION, there\u2019s a prominent UK82 backbone, yet AYUCABA eschews the street punk bent for metal leanings in a BROKEN BONES kind of way. Ripping solos, chaotic, thrashy riffage \u00e0 la BLACK UNIFORMS, Operaci\u00f3n Masacre is a behemoth album. Impressive instrumentation is bolstered by straight evil vocals, launching this into a whole other galaxy. This whispered part of the opener \u201cSistema Siniestro\u201d has Sakevi vibes, and there are nods to Japanese hardcore found throughout the album\u2019s ten tracks. A potent formula executed with deftness and precision. Can\u2019t seem to keep this one off the turntable. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Metadona Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Body Minus Head An Exercise in Self-Sufficiency LP BODY MINUS HEAD hail from Kitchener, Ontario, and play a blend of hardcore and crust punk that is emotive and gnarly. On An Exercise in Self-Sufficiency , the first full-length by the band, you\u2019ll find vocal blasts that give goosebumps, guitar licks that make you say \u201chell yeah,\u201d and a rumbly rhythm section that gets your head nodding. The majority of the songs on this ten-track album are over in less than two minutes each, so you know BODY MINUS HEAD isn\u2019t wasting time noodling around, and most of the songs hit so hard you may experience shellshock. Tracks like \u201cReset to Factory Default\u201d and \u201cUnconditional\u201d are full-on sonic pummelings, while the lyrics speak truths about the failures of the human condition. If you\u2019ve ever listened to MURDERESS\u2019s The Last Thing You Will Ever See\u2026 and said to yourself, \u201cThis could be heavier and faster,\u201d then you should absolutely check out BODY MINUS HEAD. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label No Funeral Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Citric Dummies Split With Turnstile LP Minneapolis cut-ups CITRIC DUMMIES return with their fourth LP, Split With Turnstile , which\u2014consider yourself warned\u2014is not a split with TURNSTILE at all. They put up a snotty front, but all hijinks aside, across eleven high-energy songs in twenty minutes they blast out buoyant, tongue-in-cheek punk propelled by D.V. Tinner\u2019s hyperactive drumming. It\u2019s fast without tipping into hardcore, landing somewhere between the BROKEDOWNS and DEAN DIRG. My buddy Tom says parts of it sound like a less crusty ANNIHILATION TIME, and he\u2019s not wrong. Even when they\u2019re yelling \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Anything,\u201d the whole thing still bursts with this dumb, irresistible sense of fun. I fucking love this record. Immediate top ten material. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Feel It Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Die Benjamins In 10 Jahren / Pas de Deux 7\u2033 Synth-spiked German post-punk casting backwards glances to the pop-leaning (but still properly asymmetrical) side of the Neue Deutsche Welle\u2014think \u00d6STRO 430, IDEAL, NEONBABIES, etc. That was enough to pique my interest after cueing this single up with zero background context, so imagine my surprise when I clocked that DIE BENJAMINS\u2019 vocalist Annette Benjamin was the same Annette who had been the singer (and occasional saxophonist) for late \u201970s/early \u201980s femme-punk paragons HANS-A-PLAST! Her voice is as powerful as ever here, with all of the shouty defiance and boundless energy that made \u201cRank Xerox\u201d and \u201cSex Sex Sex\u201d such indelible rippers, but while these two songs are clearly informed by her musical past, they\u2019re definitely not shackled to it. Thick, distorted bass drives the quirky/arty A-side \u201cIn 10 Jahren,\u201d periodically dissolving into washes of echoing electronics straight out of the modern Leipzig school (not unlike a punchier/less coolly detached MARAUDEUR), with the darker and more desperate atmosphere of B-side \u201cPas de Deux\u201d only heightened by Annette\u2019s soaring, passionate pleads. Totally unexpected, in the best way. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Tomatenplatten Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 East End Redemption Crashing Down LP Pop punk out of Maine that combines the melodic sensibilities of your average RAMONES-core outing with a hint of early PROPAGHANDI\u2014mainly in the vocals. In other words, this sounds like it came straight from the early years of Fat Wreck Chords. Good mixture of lighthearted lyrics paired with dystopian themes, specifically with tracks like \u201cLost Town\u201d and \u201cLacking Motivation.\u201d Nothing groundbreaking here, but it really scratches that itch if you\u2019re a fan of this era of punk. I would be remiss not to mention how great the bass tone is on this here slab. Solid production all around, actually. In my research, I came across a recycling center of the same name from the same town the group calls home. I love when bands pull their monikers from shit like that. Fantastic stuff, and would recommend for a couple spins. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Crack Rock Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Fen Fen In Yer Sights 12\u2033 Pumping stripped-down and rugged rock into the Motor City, FEN FEN unleashes a tough rip of tunes on their debut 12\u2033. Loaded with foreboding riffs and catchy lyrics, the songs are propelled by a triumphant power, at times coming across like a warped version of the HIVES. Snappy and snotty, its clean aggression makes for pure punk catharsis. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Low Ambition / Sweet Time Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Fog Spring EP FOG is a four-piece anarcho-punk band that has been very active for the past couple of years. The band\u2019s latest release, Spring , is a four-track EP that takes a hard look at the genocide of Palestinian people in Gaza with poetic and articulate lyrics. Sonically, FOG reminds me a lot of France\u2019s TOXIC RITES, with fast-paced, quick-switch punk rock forming a backdrop to the vocals. When compared to FOG\u2019s previous output, Spring comes out feeling more focused with its concise lyrical theme. The closer \u201cNo Fate\u201d is perhaps my favorite song on the EP, as it lets the instrumentals come through fully and has a playful energy while still being serious as hell. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label AlwaysNeverFun / R.I.P. Peace Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Gerinc Reklam\u00e1ci\u00f3 cassette Not everyone has an ear for melody, but certainly everyone in this group does. The guitars have a satisfying crunch, interplaying with the bass in a way that surpasses the bare minimum root note playing most punk asks of its players. In just eight brief tracks, this international Budapest-headquartered band shows a refined and biting sound brimming with harmonic turns that keep the ear on end. Citing the iconic WIPERS as a reference, tracks like \u201cDolgozz\u201d earn the right to the influence, with downpicked chugging that gives way to Greg Sage-like chiming open chords, to say nothing of \u201cMindent Belep\u201d which all but echoes the opening arpeggios of \u201cD-7.\u201d But the sound is novel and all their own. The energy never lets up, with earnest, ganged-up vocals and a drummer who keeps it close and tight. An immensely satisfying listen. Grab a tape while they\u2019re still around (they won\u2019t be for long). Reviewer Luke Henley Label Sz\u00e9gyen Kazett\u00e1k Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Hurt Hawks The Big Sweat cassette Ever wonder what it would sound like if Charles Bukowski had a Casio keyboard? Oh, are you ever in luck. HURT HAWKS are here to spit gravelly, liquor-soaked tales of debauchery and hard living in your face, accompanied by a drum preset. The opening track goes something like this: \u201cLibation! / Liberation! / The last mad days of a hedonist / If you want to bitch about it / Dial 1-800-Eat-Shit!\u201d The next track features the chant, \u201cBad whiskey, bad women, bad sex / My goddamn life is rudderless.\u201d Reading these lines, you are either snapping your fingers at your new favorite tough guy poet laureate, or rolling your eyes back into your skull like a slot machine. That\u2019s really all you need to know. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Rad Safari Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Icks The Icks cassette Five tracks of fuzzed-out, overblown four-track fidelity, with bratty vocals and drenched in Florida humidity. The ICKS ride the line between angular, fuzzed-out punk and slow and gritty mid-tempo bore-core. \u201cIDMTMTM\u201d is killer and will end up on a mixtape or two. If the tape ended here, I would love it, but they use the dreaded disco beat to lead off the next song, and that is an automatic point deduction from me. This would be best played loud while skating curbs in your local cul-de-sac, or taking resin hits from a dirty bong. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Rip Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Kibera / Solit\u00e4r split LP In sci-fi movies, especially in the \u201980s, time machines are always a big deal: incredible technological feats involving years of studies, vast amounts of unstable nuclear energy, and the possibility of changing the course of history. Listening to KIBERA is a much safer way to travel back in time, although it will not get you farther than the mid-\u201900s crust dimension. This Czech band plays raw, dark, and aggressive neocrust with harsh female vocals. I am definitely reminded of bands like AMBULANCE, EKKAIA, or even SCHIFOSI, back when the core of the subgenre still relied on the punkier, more direct side of the spectrum rather than the more emotional or polished \u201cpost-hardcore\u201d one. The six songs on this LP are firmly rooted in primitive, angry hardcore, and the listening experience is therefore pleasant if you like depressive crust. KIBERA shares the split with SOLIT\u00c4R, a rather new Prague-based unit that delivers direct, fast, and furious crustcore. Of course with a name like this, it\u2019s hard not to get the heavy nod: yes, these people are into TOTALIT\u00c4R. But, even though there is an influence (especially riff-wise), I would not place the band in the k\u00e4ng drawer overall, but clearly in the crust basement. There is a lot of energy on this recording, and it certainly more than makes up for some moments that don\u2019t totally work for me. The relentless feel really works well here, and on that level I am reminded of bands like INFEKCJA, local classics like MASS GENOCIDE PROCESS or even MASSGRAVE, or some Brazilian thrashing hardcore at times (because of the fast-paced vocals, probably). On the whole, a solid split LP, and a relevant display of fast and aggressive punk music from Czechia. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Crust as Fuck / Phobia / Svab Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Lebende Tiere Uwaga cassette New release on Berlin, Germany\u2019s Flennen label from LEBENDE TIERE with their Uwaga cassette.\u00a0 From what I can tell, this is the band\u2019s debut, and I assume they are also from Berlin?\u00a0 The songs are fun and fast, featuring bouncy drums and bass, and higher-register guitar tones with a perfect amount of crunch that squabble in some forever-turmoil under the shouted direction of a lively vocalist.\u00a0 Everything feels electric, frantic, and\u2026a little odd or eggy? For example, the vocals in \u201cAchtung Pferde\u201d are replaced by the neighs and whinnies of a horse.\u00a0 So that\u2019s fun. They may have had me with the red-on-pink cassette jacket, but the music rips, too! Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Flennen Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Middle-Aged Queers Theatre of Shame CD I guess this might be the feel-good, laugh-steady queer punk album of the year, unless there\u2019s another one. These are catchy songs, not unlike PANSY DIVISION or some DIESEL QUEENS tunes. Among the laughs and fun-time-party-guy stuff, the MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS pepper in some lyrically heavy songs, exemplified by the tunes \u201cBig Sisters\u201d and \u201cNobody Wants.\u201d I initially was ready to toss this into the WEIRD AL punk category, but MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS have more than that to offer. Look, WEIRD AL punk is a fine place to be, I like a lot of it, but all I\u2019m saying is that MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS have more than just songs funny about slumber parties, kinks, and anal beads. And just in time for Xmas, the MIDDLE-AGED QUEERS have a fully stocked online merch presence! Reviewer Tony Party Label Engineer / Sell the Heart Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Nape Neck The Shallowest End LP I won\u2019t beat around the bush, folks\u2014Leeds trio NAPE NECK\u2019s first LP The Shallowest End utterly and totally stunned me. This thing is a perfect mess of puzzling bass lines, proudly no wave guitars, and incredibly fucked-up drum beats. What\u2019s crazier is the fact that all three members are singing while breezing through those dazzling signature changes and sharp turns in composition. I mean, how? How is it possible for three people to make that much noise and make it make sense? It\u2019s an absolutely explosive and electrifying noise rock freakout, and I\u2019m head over heels in love with it. Ring-ring : Hey Alex, I know I already submitted it, but is it possible to make a few changes to my year-end top ten? Reviewer Mama Goblin Label Dot Dash Sounds / OCCii / Red Wig Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Problem With Kids Today Take It! CD These guys come out of the gates swinging, with some straightforward, melodic, and catchy punk\u2019n\u2019roll. When the vocals themselves are melodic and also a group effort, I just find that kind of infectious. There\u2019s a rawness that reminds me of early REPLACEMENTS, without really having that sound. It\u2019s just the energy. But then they take a different turn and sound almost like the CLEAN. Towards the end, they put together back-to-back-to-back songs all under a minute each. That\u2019s how to win my heart. Excellent album. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label In the Shed Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Reds The Truth of Impermanence 12\u2033 REDS! Liked the movie, love the band. Full disclosure, I have known these folks for some time and we cut our teeth on the same kinds of punk rock. Kids of the \u201990s, I tell ya. This new release is called The Truth of Impermanence , and it is out on Council Records. \u201cSo You Say\u201d showcases vocalist Evan Kilgore\u2019s sass and snarl, with quiet vocals reminiscent of some of my favorite Ian MacKaye vocals both in FUGAZI and MINOR THREAT. This record is quite polished in terms of production, but the essence of punk is foregrounded and intact. \u201cEnergy\u201d reminds me a lot of my favorite Louisville bands, and the first couple of guitar and vocal lines reached into my core, surprising me with how emotional it made me. There are creative and inventive bass lines peppered throughout, as well as driving, solid drumming. Some of my favorite patterns emerge in the song \u201cThe Body,\u201d with well-placed call-and-response instrumentation and noodling. These are the anthems I think we all need in these times, especially as they relate to human dignity and bodily autonomy themes. The treble at the end along with Evan\u2019s shouts makes me wanna punch a fist in the sky. Fans of Dischord will like REDS, and fans of liberation writ large will find something in this as well. Reviewer Katy Otto Label Council Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Sin\ua4d8s Pleasure to Burn EP The A-side is a slow-burner that doesn\u2019t really hold my interest. The B-side has two more punk\u2019n\u2019roll tunes that are a bit faster but still not very interesting to me. These three tunes feel a bit uninspired, which seems weird since the members have been in bands such as POISON IDEA, SMEGMA, OILY BLOODMEN, EXACERBATORS, LOVESORES, and so on. I guess I\u2019m a bit surprised by the lack of impact. Reviewer Tony Party Label Sonic Jett Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Sleeveens Downtown / Drowning 7\u2033 The hits keep on coming for the SLEEVEENS. The latest offering from this Nashville/Dublin combo shows their continued ability to take three-minute songs and make them feel like epic journeys. A lot of this amplification and magnification of sounds and sensations surely comes first from the emotive vocal delivery, but the instrumentation across the board definitely bears load on these creations. \u201cDowntown\u201d specifically just feels larger than life, and also shows that the band is really finding their sweet spot. Their first single, \u201cGive My Regards to the Dancing Girls,\u201d was an awesome way to debut their sound, but it did leave me wondering a bit about the decision of the over-five-minute runtime. When the song appeared again as the opening track to their debut full-length, the track was cut down by almost three minutes, which then ironically left me wondering about all that was left off of it. The three-minute runtime of \u201cDowntown\u201d hits every note with every second sounding vital, surely pleasing even the fussiest of the punk rock Goldilockses. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Goner Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Spatter Pattern Atomic Dinette / TV Casualty 7\u2033 Two tracks of DIY minimal synth punk from Michigan. Both sides throb with thick, warmly produced synth tones, crisp drum machines, and cynical spoken/sung vocals. \u201cTV Casualty\u201d got a few extra plays due to its noisy buzzing frequencies that accompany the main dancefloor rhythm and infectious chorus railing against the influence of television (a quaint concern these days). Bleak, catchy, and worth a listen. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Mutated Pink Fuzz Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Sweepers Sweepers cassette Self-released cassette version of an LP released on Abandon Everything Records. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was this confused by a band. A novelty punk project about sweeping? I guess it\u2019s impressive that one can write that many songs about sweeping. Between this full-length recording and the band\u2019s initial demo, that\u2019s over 25 songs, of which the only subject matter seems to be\u2026sweeping. Hell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve swept the floors of my house as many times as this band has songs about the act of sweeping. To make it all that much more confusing, musically this is something of an artsy free jazz project, wrapped in novelty punk packaging. Maybe I\u2019m the wrong person for this kind of \u201cpunk.\u201d Halfway into this band\u2019s eighteen-song LP (too long), and I\u2019m ready to sweep this under the damn rug. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Toy Tiger Meow Sabotage LP TOY TIGER, a DIY five-piece from Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside, dish out \u201970s glam- and Oi!-influenced street rock built around steady, down-the-middle playing and explicitly anti-racist, anti-authoritarian, pro-LGBTQ2+ lyrics. Meow Sabotage , their second full-length, sticks to that formula and spends most of its time parked in the same mid-tempo lane. The overall effect reminded me more of \u201980s L.A. sleaze rock\u2014like they could have opened for FASTER PUSSYCAT on the Strip\u2014than T. REX\u2019s shimmer. Nothing here knocked me sideways, and a lot of the tracks blur together, but Bugsy Faithfull\u2019s vocals were a standout, shifting between a controlled street punk snarl and a \u201950s-tinged Danzig croon. I have a feeling these songs hit harder when you\u2019re shoulder-to-shoulder in a bar, singing along and getting swept up in the message with the people around you. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Street Rats Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Who Pays Hard Times EP What a year for NYC\u2019s WHO PAYS\u2014they wrecked stages across the country, dropped this killer EP, and (checking notes) loaned Captain Sensible a pair of pants. Anyway, that new EP, Hard Times , features five original cuts of powerhouse HC and an equally aggro BABY HUEY cover. They sort of remind me of Cleveland\u2019s INMATES if they traded the AGNOSTIC FRONT influence for POISON IDEA. You get the picture, this thing fuckin\u2019 rocks. Highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label 11 PM Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 V/A Somos El Peligro Social: Un Homenaje a Ultimo Resorte LP Seminal early \u201980s act ULTIMO RESORT left a lasting impact on not just their home turf of Barcelona, but on Spanish punk as a whole, which would explain the wide scope of groups united in homage on this sprawling tribute album. During their original run spanning from 1979 to 1984, the band channeled numerous styles, ranging from speedy hardcore to anthemic UK82, and the lineup of groups covering them here is equally diverse. Everybody from the ass-kicking DISTHROAT to technopunk experimenters ECM showed up to drop a track and pay respect. There are 24 tracks in total, packaged with a poster in this fitting follow-up to the retrospective LP that came out in 2023. Reviewer Jason Harding Label 16 Forever / BCore / Little Jan's Hammer / Victim / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Action Party The Action Party CD The ACTION PARTY is a tepid rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. Maybe you could say this is like a flaccid JONESES and stuff like that. I\u2019m betting their shows are a rocking good time, maybe. I\u2019m not sure this was quite the right place to send this for review. This is fine, well-produced rock\u2019n\u2019roll that might fit in better on a \u201cBest of the \u201890s\u201d college/alternative rock CD.I guess the one positive thing I can say is that I dozed off a couple times while listening to this, so if you are a little sleep-deprived, then this is the CD for you. Reviewer Tony Party Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Bahia de Kotxinos Bahia Kotxinos LP This is a strange piece of ephemera; a long-abandoned debut by Euskara band BAHIA DE KOTXINOS, who by all accounts were a leading light in an active scene and had a record ready to go that was left on the shelf, gathering Basque dust for the next 30 years. Now lovingly remastered and released into the world, it\u2019s a peculiar document of a very specific scene. It has the taut, frantic energy of yer DEVOs, yer WIREs, yer ADVERTS of the world. However, it also has the sort of wacky, clever-dick stylings of a kind of proto-egg-punk too, which is unfortunate. It\u2019s certainly a lot more interesting than I was anticipating, and well worth your time, albeit three whole decades later than you should have enjoyed it. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Discos Enfermos / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Bootcamp Time\u2019s Up LP Who doesn\u2019t like a great hardcore record that makes one punch a hole through a wall? Strap on your boots, because it\u2019s time to slam with Iowa City\u2019s BOOTCAMP. Proper USHC delivered in an intense manner, sounding fresh but remaining true to the classic tropes. You will find them on the same record store shelf as ARMOR and some of the 11 PM releases. Time\u2019s Up , go listen to this! Now! Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Convulse Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Dick Spikie Ultra Punk 4Cycle Vol. 1 EP Three fantastic Japanese Oi! tracks that will bring you to your feet to pogo with the best of them. Much like the BUSINESS and BLITZ, this trio of D-beat classics are equal parts catchy and rowdy as hell. \u201cRestriction & Freedom\u201d is the cream of this crop, an earworm that led me to spinning the A-side quite a few times. On the B-side, we have a song called \u201cYou\u2019re a Bastard\u201d that features some of my favorite lyrics of the year. Here\u2019s a taste: \u201cYou\u2019re a bastard / Wipe your arse yourself.\u201d Fair enough. For my money, Japanese Oi! has always sounded the most authentic, and this is no different.

Mining his Indigenous roots, soul jazz, and funk, it\u2019s a fantastic album, and it completes a trilogy that began with 2019\u2019s All My Relations , continued with 2021\u2019s Baca Sewa , and now concludes. Gene Ammons :: Nice an\u2019 Cool (1961) Posted on December 16, 2025 December 15, 2025 True to Moodsville\u2019s curation, Nice \u2018an Cool is nothing if not a \u201cmood album,\u201d the overall unity of the quartet eclipsing any one section of the arrangement. The band keeps dynamics to a gentle hush; Ammons plays his melody lines straight, keeping embellishments to a bare minimum. Still, the ear can\u2019t help but single out Ammons\u2019 tenor sax. His tone is unmistakable: deep, rich, and warm. He doesn\u2019t so much play notes as he breathes his soul into them, tinting each legato phrase with a lifetime\u2019s worth of dreams and regrets. A John Waters Christmas (2004) Posted on December 16, 2025 December 11, 2025 Christmas provides the perfect setting for Waters to juxtapose with his subversive authorship: taking something cheerful, domestic, and sentimental and gleefully deforming it into tawdry anarchy. So it should come as no surprise that when New Line Records asked the cult icon to compile a Christmas album, Waters curated a track listing far off the beaten path of Bing Crosby and Andy Williams. \u201cI think a few of these songs are awful,\u201d Waters would say. \u201cBut they\u2019re so awful, they\u2019re perfect.\u201d Eberhard Weber on ECM: Primary Colours Posted on December 15, 2025 December 11, 2025 ECM may exist without Eberhard Weber, but it wouldn\u2019t be ECM as we know it. From his 1973 debut through decades of collaboration, Weber\u2019s ECM catalog is difficult to absorb, with offshoots that aren\u2019t for every taste. Still, it\u2019s a body of work that rewards exploration. Here\u2019s one path among many. The Blue Nile :: Hats Posted on December 11, 2025 December 11, 2025 The Blue Nile\u2019s Hats is filled with lovesick people and nocturnal places, existing in a perpetual state of starless nights and slanted rainfall. The album evokes a liminal metropolis bathed in the amber glow of sodium-vapor street lamps, where lonely souls wander down moonlit alleyways in search of something that has already left them long ago. It is here, where traffic lights blink for no one and smoke curls around sewer lids, that Hats stakes its home. It sustains this atmosphere from beginning to end \u2014 each song a jigsaw puzzle piece that forms a mosaic of romance and sorrow.
