Artists from both metropolitan areas have released some exceptional music this year. Here are a few favorites. Love it local.

Across decades of records, he\u2019s built a reputation on candor, dry humor, and a songwriter\u2019s instinct for finding grace in the wreckage of ordinary life. Live a Little, his new album, feels like a distilled version of that ethos.

It\u2019s been said before, but Billionaire makes it worth repeating. Edwards has never been one to mince words.

The dynamics shift constantly\u2014bobbing, weaving, building tension that reverberates from somewhere in the distance before crashing into the present moment. \u201cPretty Linda\u201d offers [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Americana , Playlists , Pop , Reviews , Rock , Singer/Songwriter , Streams , Videos Tagged With: American Mile , Jade Bird , Joelton Mayfield , John Calvin Abney , Julianna Riolino , Silver Lining , Terra Lightfoot , Trapper Schoepp , William Prince , Zoe Pete Ford Afton Wolfe \u2013 Ophiuchus Thursday, December 04, 2025 By Shawn Underwood I\u2019ve noted before that I\u2019m a fan of concept albums. I have not seen anyone embrace it quite the way Nashville-by-way-of-Mississippi resident Afton Wolfe did on his newest record, Ophiuchus. Each of the 13 songs is associated with one of the 12 well-known signs of the zodiac, plus one for the lesser known Ophiuchus.

Meanwhile, here in Twangville, we\u2019re doing what we always do: sharing recs, falling in love with new records, and giving thanks for the music that gets us through it all.

Musselwhite of course was great, but the young lead guitarist, Matthew Stubbs, piqued my intrest so much I sought out his early solo albums \u2013 Soul Bender and Medford & Main.

They go to a bluegrass show to hear the performer\u2019s music, whether written by themselves or someone else. So I found it intriguing to listen to Trish Imbrogno\u2019s (aka Trish Plays Bass) debut EP.

They did that on their own accord. Now, at the end of that same year the label WormHoleDeath has picked them up and has decided that a rerelease through them is in order. And in order to add to the pleasure of the music the label decided that the addition of the EP \u201cMore Dread\u201d that came after the album was more than justified. Kali Ptolemea What I have hear with \u201cKali\u201d is the second album of this Alternative Rock band, the debut being \u201cBalanced Darkness\u201d from 2023. I haven\u2019t heard that one, but I have a feeling that is about to change, as to me what PTOLEMEA brings on \u201cKali\u201d is nothing less than interesting, and at times even bloody good. Carnival Puppeteers Stargazery I think there are enough people around to really appreciate what STARGAZERY plays in the 53 minutes that make \u201cCarnival Puppeteers\u201d. Oh, and look out for the two covers, from DIO and DEF LEPPARD. they are quite alright... Human Eclipse Urban Dream What URBAN DREAM does is make it very hard for a promotor to do their job properly, as how do you market a band that intertwines Industrial Metal, Gothic Rock, Alternative and Pop-Rock influences into everything they do. Transcendent Chaos Spirit Of Rebellion Say no more! I'm sat for\u00a0\"Transcendent Chaos.\" Ode to the Dead Fallstaff Ode to the Dead,\u00a0the newest album from brass metal pioneers from Montreal,\u00a0Fallstaff,\u00a0is interesting to say [\u2026] Gloriae Inhuman The newest album from Portuguese metal band\u00a0Inhuman, Gloriae,is very unique to say the least. With [\u2026] Through High Holy Haze St. Unholyness Metal fans of all kinds can find something in this album to enjoy from Doom to Stoner to Groove to Black, Christina touches on it all. Brahman Breath If slow jam Doom is your thing, then you\u2019ll probably like this album. Genesis Clocktowers The best part of the album was the bass guitar work. It was audible, thick, meaty, and animated, but it just wasn\u2019t enough to make the effort memorable for me. It was a promising start for the duo, but next time, I want to hear more of their personality in their music. Tro, h\u00e5p og kj\u00e6rlighet Fanatisme Fysisk Format is excited to announce the signing of FANATISME and the release of their [\u2026] Power To The Past Risen Atlantis A solid power metal album... just, like, don't use AI for the artwork next time. Please? Exitus Triumphalis Svntarer Some paths we don\u2019t choose in life we find ourselves walking down, nonetheless. These frigid, black trails are representative of the bleaker side of life. Whether what you feel is anger, despair, or horror, these feelings are alive in you, and you can use them to motivate you through dark times, or succumb to the darkness. That is the takeaway I have from the album. Der Torv Moeter Hav Heimland This wasn\u2019t a bad album per se, and the meaty bass notes were one of its best features. Unfortunately, it just sounded too much like FWOBM inspired music for me, and it wasn\u2019t diverse enough to really get off the ground. Cycle of the Dying Sun (Dawn of Ashen Realms) Runemagick Overall, this wasn\u2019t a bad album by any stretch, it just didn\u2019t challenge me much as a listener. Many of the songs had a similar sound and the slow pace didn\u2019t combine well with the somewhat bland riffs. Lore Cultic Cultic,\u00a0the newest album from the Pennsylvania extreme metal band,\u00a0Lore is definitely a strange and different [\u2026] Leo Rising Danko Jones Formed in 1996 Danko Jones hail from Ontario Canada.Over their nearly 30 year history the [\u2026] Shady Side Of Town EP Electric Boys The Electric Boys from Stockholm Sweden were formed in 1988,a band who\u2019s roots are 70\u2019s [\u2026] Set The Dark On Fire Edenbridge I am hesitant to call \"Set The Dark On Fire\" their best album ever, but it just might be. Poems of Spellcraft Draculum Each of the six tracks is a bit of mystery, beckoning the listener to unravel them. Signposted by year, the titles hint at a possible unified narrative if not by characters than at least by theme. Light and Desolation Blizaro Light and Desolation,\u00a0the newest album from doom metal band\u00a0Blizaro,\u00a0is nothing short of weird and bizarre, [\u2026] Dismal Thoughts Abysmal Descent \u201cDismal Thoughts\u201d goes beyond traditional Death Metal; it smartly blends Death Metal with Doom Metal and progressive elements The Second Death Katakomba \u201cThe Second Death\u201d delivers traditional Swedish Death Metal sound with modern elements. The album has pace, rawness, aggression, devastating chainsaw guitars, and a blood-freezing melodic framework Legends Sabaton There is not one wrong note on this album. All the songs are well balanced, very easy for the ears and most of all, of a very high quality. I can only applaud what I hear on \u201cLegends\u201d, as SABATON have once again given you a completely finished product that is ready to be admired. Built To Destroy N.Y.C. It is clear for me that N.Y.C. comes over a lot stronger, makes a lot better impression when they play loud and straight ahead. That\u2019s when the class and their experience shows itself, when they really have an impact with \u201cBuilt To Destroy\u201d. Burning Death Burning Death BURNING DEATH might be the band to reach superstar status, but as long as they\u2019re around they\u2019re bringing us as listeners a lot of pleasure with \u201cBurning Death\u201d. Black Widow Nebula Caelestra Synths kept a steady presence throughout, sometimes rising with a fist and other times settling back in the shadows, but they were always knocking. Harsh vocals brought a measure of hard truth to the album, while cleans kept things pristine at times. It was the way these things were combined into a seasoned stew that made for such an an excellent listening experience. Rat City Rockers Casket Rats Casket Rats are a a gritty,no nonsense,analog focused Hard Rock.The band deliver raw,street fighting,unapologetic rock [\u2026] Shadows Of The Dying Light Sarayasign Sarayasign return with \"Shadows Of The Dying Light\", their most ambitious release yet\u2014a sweeping, cinematic [\u2026] Malicious Spears Archaic Thorn Ahh. Hand-drawn cover art. It's nice to see. Precipice Lychgate A precipice is the edge of a very steep cliff, and that\u2019s what I felt the entire time...standing so close to death. This was a pleasantly strange, unsettling listening experience for me, and the closest feeling that I can think of to describing it might be either the liberation, or the horrible guilt, one feels when they have just taken the soul from a fellow human. S\u00f3 Quem Viu o Rel\u00e2mpago \u00e0 Sua Direita Sabe Kaatayra After two listens, I am still not entirely sure what I think about the album. The band leaves the door open for mystery, and even your own imagination. Harsh vocals contrast with traditional Brazilian folk music in a way that just keeps you on your toes throughout the experience, and if nothing else, its mysteries are buried deep within. The Wild Card Treat The songs themselves are simple and straight forward, they just come to the point. If you are looking for intricate structures, for different sorts of breaks and/or all kinds of variety in a song, forget it. If you want all those ingredients throughout the record, you are in for a TREAT, as \u201cThe Wild Card\u201d has all that in spades. A Test Of Strength Zero Tolerance A Test Of Strength\u201d is a solid, decent but also extremely entertaining album. I doubt that ZERO TOLERANCE will achieve world dominance with this album but I am sure that they are going to gain a lot of praise from a lot of Thrash and Heavy Metal fans. The Carcass Choir Monachopsis \"A techdeathmess from the midlands,\" you say... Canvas Mors Verum When I hear the term Death Metal, I get images of rotting flesh, destruction and death, and even guttural noise. But here, the music was alive\u2026moving, breathing, never standing still. It\u2019s ardent enough for the common fan, but also offers a kaleidoscope of other sounds for those of us looking for something different. More results...

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game.

Well, you know what they say: never let them know your next move. Mysterious Polish-Italian collective Amalekim garnered praise in these hallowed halls with their 2023 release Avodah Zarah , our own Thus Spoke calling it a highlight during a weaker year for the genre. Naturally, I disliked the album, which tends to be a good sign for the average black metal fan. I was nevertheless surprised to see Shir Hashirim released to little fanfare or label promotion after such a positive reception 18 months prior.\u201d Pole vaulting.

Please include contact information and let us know where your band is from! 100 Flowers Presence of Mind EP reissue Shortly after the URINALS changed their name to 100 FLOWERS, they cemented the switch with the release of this artsy 7\u201d in 1982. A bit more explorational than their earlier output, which brought us dum-dum classics like \u201cI\u2019m A Bug\u201d and \u201cAck Ack Ack Ack,\u201d the band\u2019s evolved style on this three-song EP is more in line with the sound of early WIRE and PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED. The dark disco of the title track leads the proceedings, an energetic post-punk number that would eventually make its way onto the group\u2019s LP the following year. Next up, the brief and bouncy \u201cDyslexia\u201d quickly reminds us that we\u2019re still dealing with the same guys that wrote \u201cI Am White and Middle Class.\u201d On the flipside, \u201cMop Dub\u201d is an instrumental backwards treatment of \u201cPresence of Mind,\u201d providing a symmetrical bookend that suits the fashion of the era. Faithfully reissued in its original format, this poignant little slab documents the iconic unit\u2019s transition from weird to weirder. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Spacecase Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Axe Il Cimitero \u00e8 Dappertutto cassette Italy\u2019s Sistema Mortal has had an excellent year, starting off with the head-splitting FARCE 7\u201d and wrapping things up with this killer debut from Milan\u2019s AXE. Featuring two vocalists and a raw, crusty sound, AXE plays with a little more texture and melody (and I think keyboard) than your usual D-beat fare. Opening track \u201cPatto di Sangue\u201d kicks off with an ominously dark tone that quickly morphs into full on m\u00e4ngel fury that doesn\u2019t let up for the entirety of the tape. A total scorcher and highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Sistema Mortal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Billiam The Letter W & the Numeral B EP Melbourne\u2019s BILLIAM is back with another EP, his fourth release this year. There\u2019s nothing new here, and any of the four tracks could have appeared on any of the project\u2019s previous efforts. If you\u2019ve enjoyed any of his other records, you\u2019ll dig this. \u201cNew Wave\u201d and \u201cHouston We Have Rock\u201d are full of fuzzy three-chord punk, battered with synthesizers and left scrambling to catch up to the lo-fi hi-hats working overtime in the background. The vocals sound like they were recorded through a cell phone inside of a cave, which kind of ruins it for me, although repeating the phrase \u201cHouston, we have rock\u201d 16 times in 54 seconds brought a smile to my face. The B-side is more mid-tempo and features the highlight of the EP for me, the closing \u201cEssential Feedstock Oils,\u201d where they repeat the word \u201crecord\u201d 27 times in 90 seconds. Heavy SPARKS vibes with a bedroom charm. It ain\u2019t for me, but fans of 1-800-MIKEY and GEE TEE will eat it up. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Low Ambition Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 C.A.M.O. Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry 12\u2033 If you played this for me and told me it came out in 1985, I\u2019d believe you, but C.A.M.O. out of Vienna, Austria exists in 2025, and thanks to Mendeku Diskak, their cassette Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry is now available as a vinyl disc. Anarcho-punk with a cold bent makes C.A.M.O. sound indignant and haunting, and this eight-song album is full of sonic macabre with ominous lyrics and guitar riffs that sound adjacent to funeral marches. If you dig early KILLING JOKE, 1919, or PART1, then go check out C.A.M.O. right now. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Condumb Disassociation EP Crasher-crust noise punk from Philadelphia. It\u2019s a well-crafted 7\u201d where both the songwriting and the smart usage of the classic pedal arsenal are strong\u2014there is a good balance between fast- and mid-tempos, and the screaming vocals let the songs breathe but sound forceful when they\u2019re happening. The songs are so well-written that they would work without the screaming/swirling jet sounds of the guitar, which in could go against the noise-not-music ethos within the record, as the added effects are not masking rather traditional songs but upgrading primitive, non-existent ideas to something truly otherworldly. Here, the noise is masking knowledge and talent if you let yourself lead into mindless headbanging (which the record offers), but if you arrive via the main bands of the members, you probably will not feel cheated, either. Or if you listen beyond aesthetics and pay attention to what is actually happening. Nowadays, the look and slogans of this style seem more popular than ever, yet most bands do not come close to getting the essence of this sound. CONDUMB does; they get it and do it just right. Reviewer Viktor Vargyai Label Stupid Bag Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dead Bug 6 or 12 New Songs cassette NYC/Richmond, CA duo DEAD BUG\u2019s 6 or 12 New Songs is not really an album, but more of an experiment on interpreting visual data and translating it into music. It goes like this: there is a zine called 5 New Songs which has cryptic drawings and enigmatic descriptions that symbolize abstract ideas for five different songs. Both members of the band work alone to write and record their respective sides with their interpretation of what those songs would sound like. The results are really interesting and it\u2019s definitely a thought-provoking experiment. But I think reviewing and trying to describe how it sounds would defeat its purpose, as it requires listeners to connect the dots between the music and the visuals. I highly recommend checking it out and maybe even trying it yourself. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Embittered This Failed Endeavor cassette Raw, pissed-off hardcore punk with a distinctly bleak tone. EMBITTERED tears through short, furious tracks driven by urgent drumming and a bitter vocal delivery. The cassette format suits the band perfectly\u2014lo-fi but powerful, emphasizing frustration, alienation, and total rejection of false optimism. Hardcore meant to be felt, not polished. Hardcore punk crudo y cargado de bronca, con un tono marcadamente sombr\u00edo. Embittered avanzan a trav\u00e9s de canciones cortas y furiosas, impulsadas por una bater\u00eda urgente y voces cargadas de resentimiento. El formato cassette le sienta perfecto al material: sonido \u00e1spero, directo, enfocado en la frustraci\u00f3n y el rechazo absoluto al optimismo vac\u00edo. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Hey Fuck You Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Fungas Intelligence 1 LP Sci-fi egg-punk from Australia that mixes DEVO-core vocals and herky-jerky rhythms with maximum dork power (they\u2019re really into rocks, apparently?). Sneaky spy riffs tangle with alien synths for a familiar but fun high-energy blast. \u201ci1\u201d pulls back the shtick just a bit to allow classic new wave melodies to emerge and build a near-perfect multi-layered pop song. If you like this kind of stuff, you\u2019ll like this record\u2014it\u2019s well-produced and carefully composed for maximum party impact. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Erste Theke Tontr\u00e4ger Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Holly and the Nice Lions Dolores LP I went to Green Bay UFO Museum Gift Shop and Records for the first time a few years ago when I decided to drive the northern route around Lake Michigan to Minneapolis. I walked out of there with some great records on Amphetamine Reptile and a Darth Vader bank for my cousin that would activate with every road bump and say \u201cImpressive, most impressive, you are not a Jedi yet.\u201d There were a lot of bumps. Still, with that slap-tickle memory, I was excited to see that they had something to do with this release. I researched (typed into an Internet browser) Certified PR Records and found that they are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, where long-ago Maximum Rocknroll shitworker, reviewer, columnist, and interviewer Lali D lives, so it can\u2019t be that bad. I heard that St. Pete has a good glass arts scene, too. This Dolores LP starts off with a song clocking in at over four minutes, pulling from the dark side of the dirge-like, cloud-covered Midwest, but around the two-minute mark, it becomes a straight-up middle-finger rocker. This easily could have been on Sympathy for the Record Industry with its lean into the punk side of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. The standout on this is the HOLLY part of HOLLY AND THE NICE LIONS band, and her direct and committed vocals. Oftentimes I\u2019ve felt that singers can tend to overdo it with screaming to try and get across their disgust or pain or anger, but in this instance, HOLLY uses good songwriting coupled with subtle vocal tones and inflection to let you know she\u2019s had enough. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t touch on Steven Spoerl\u2019s bass-playing that complements every song, almost as though another dim and somber conversation is taking place somewhere in the same room, with Travis Pashek\u2019s drums pulling you forward through a late-night drive north, hugging the lake shore alone with everything getting darker and darker. This record, in sum, is thoughtful, heavy, dark, empowering, sorrowful, and redeeming rock\u2019n\u2019roll/punk/sludge/garage. Dolores is for those times that you want to be alone to work out what\u2019s been bugging you. HOLLY AND THE NICE LIONS have been a band for over a decade, and I\u2019m a bit sad that I\u2019m just hearing them now. In closing, my cousin loved his Darth Vader bank, and think he\u2019s going to love this record, too. He\u2019s 53. Reviewer Tony Party Label Certified PR / Green Bay UFO Museum Gift Shop and Records Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Industry Industry LP Berlin-based INDUSTRY has been gathering steam from the past two years and has finally unleashed their self-titled full-length. Burly punk rock with jazz compositions and an aggro vibe creates a ten-song LP that reads as monolithic but is overtly so much more. In other words, lyrics born out of exasperation are delivered over rumbling rhythms and grinding guitars that shift grooves frequently, but always seem to get your head banging. If you\u2019ve had your fill of AXEGRINDER and are looking for something more, then look no further than INDUSTRY. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label La Vida Es Un Mus Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Lake Inferior Five Ahead / Avoid All Robots 7\u2033 Wow, this is a phenomenal pair of songs here. Sinister doom-goth-surf rock, as if WEEDEATER decided they wanted to sound more like the CRAMPS and Danzig-era MISFITS. I love the unintentional (at least I assume it\u2019s unintentional) irony of their song \u201cFive Ahead,\u201d which features the lyrics \u201cFive years ahead of our time / Ten years behind.\u201d This certainly sounds like it\u2019s from the future and not at all dated or \u201cbehind.\u201d The B-side (\u201cAvoid All Robots\u201d) is equal parts retro-futuristic and a cautionary tale for our current AI-addled society. Really great slab here. Highly recommended. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Model Martel A Thousand Couple Times LP MODEL MARTEL has a parallel sound with many bands on Tiny Engines Records and the Lauren Records style of Midwest-centric emo-punk-pop-core. This is shitty jobs, friends you can\u2019t depend on, broken relationships, expecting more from life, and finding comfort in late night talks, all wrapped in guitar hooks and melancholic melody. If I were 25 years younger, I would be calling this my favorite record of 2025 because of how it encapsulates life\u2019s twenties and thirties. A solid, lyrically-focused rite of passage LP, open-eyed on broken and healing, punctuated with tight bass and drums. There are only 300 of these LPs, on all of the different colors that an LP could be, perhaps. A Thousand Couple Times , although budding with infectious hooks, has a regretful and foreboding lyrical sorrow to it that always seems to be amplified by a band\u2019s proximity to the Great Lakes. Reviewer Tony Party Label Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Not This Record Contains Not One Hit Single\u2026 + I Do Not Care!!! CD Off-kilter Japanese punkers NOT existed in the early 2000s, sticking around for just long enough to record the thirteen rough-hewn tracks showcased on this CD. Injecting straightforward \u201977 punk in the vein of the KNOCKS with a bit of modern meddle like the BLACK AND WHITE, the band\u2019s sound is ultimately a quirky take on \u201990s garage punk style. The opening groove to \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Back to Me\u201d is a straight-up REGISTRATORS swipe, and the winding instrumental \u201cMituwadai 101\u201d sounds like it could be a GASOLINE jam session captured in uncharacteristically clean fidelity. Tracks one through eight are from the band\u2019s most realized recording, titled This Record Contains Not One Hit Single , and the remaining songs are taken from their 2004 demo ( I Do Not Care ), bringing you the full NOT experience on one disc. A brief interview with the group\u2019s founder Hidde included in this package alludes to a reunion gig slated for 2026, so keep an eye out if you happen to find yourself in Chiba prefecture this coming year. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Private Scandal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dre Perish Twist of Fate LP New Orleans artist/producer DRE PERISH (also of the noise punk duo QUARTER RATS) is a self-styled \u201cpsych punk/no wave junkie,\u201d and their new LP seems to push that identity in every direction at once. PERISH handles vocals, guitar, bass, synths, sax, beats, and samples, with guest players dropping in on about half the tracks. Across its eleven songs and three field recordings, the album meanders between styles like a Tuesday-night CBGB audition lineup: opening with a NINE INCH NAILS-leaning opener, then a detour into alternative/art rock, the rumble of a passing train, and then \u201cAll Night!\u201d\u2014the standout for me, which sounds like it could\u2019ve come off one of the more chaotic OSEES recordings. There\u2019s also a crunchy/synthy cover of GANG OF FOUR\u2019s \u201cTo Hell With Poverty!\u201d I found myself gravitating toward the tracks played with real instruments and patiently waiting for the synth-heavy ones to end, but that\u2019s just personal taste. For most people, this will either be a challenging listen or a novelty, but if you\u2019ve got a wide-open brain and enjoy listening to an artist follow every weird instinct, Twist of Fate might be an entertaining journey. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Primitive Postures / Strange Daisy Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Precipice Down the Well 12\u2033 PRECIPICE is a band that formed during COVID and put out a demo that I heard yet quickly lost interest in. Down the Well is a welcomed return, and is demonstrative of the Nantes group strengthening and turning the knobs. Bass-driven in an almost KILLDOZER-like way, the eight tracks are spread evenly with hate and indignation. A minute-long beatdown with \u201cA Customary Behavior in a Particular Situation\u201d is my mixtape track. Good bruisers. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Discos Enfermos / Urticaria Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Royal Scum Human Gallantry EP This is a perfect example of a cover being a poor illustration of the music included on the record. In terms of semiotics, using a rather gruesome black-and-white picture of a horse being hung on a deck points to growling, nihilistic grindcore, but ROYAL SCUM from Hamburg does not belong to that school, rather playing heavy and dark crusty hardcore with some moody melodies. The band is actually more of a collective and does not have a fixed lineup, so I do not know if the members of this version of the band were around in the \u201900s, but I would bet they were because ROYAL SCUM has that typical quite well-produced neocrusty sound that was so popular back then. It would be far-fetched to claim that they stand as an all-out FROM ASHES RISE-type band, but early/mid-\u201900s ACURSED or UNKIND come to mind, although they do not sound quite as bleak, and the vocal delivery in English\u2014as well as the use of several angry singers\u2014makes me think of US bands (like ANTIPRODUCT, maybe?). With ROYAL SCUM being pro-vegan, I assume the cover is meant to reflect human cruelty toward animals, and I would guess the band is not too keen on the monarchy (even if Germany, besides Franz Beckenbauer, has not had a king for a while). On the whole, Human Gallantry is a pretty solid listen if you enjoy this sort of politically-driven, heavy, angry hardcore with dark melodies, and the EP works well and does perfectly what it set out to do. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Aktiver Ausstand In Plastik / Bolzkow / Frontcore / Zann's Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Slang Rest in Misery LP Sapporo City legends return after a decade of silence with all the subtlety of a bomb blast. Stoke-on-Trent meets NYHC in a glorious amalgamation that still sounds fresh and innovative over thirty years on. The vitality and rage hasn\u2019t faded in the least, and one gets the sense that SLANG has reemerged in response to the deteriorating global political climate. In the face of so much avoidable death and exploitation, the outrage laid bare across the nine tracks of Rest in Misery is palpable. Prank isn\u2019t as active as they once were, but they always deliver the goods. No exception here, just raging Japanese hardcore with a metallic bent that will make you want to run through a wall. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Prank Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Stare Kits Live in NYC 1979 LP STARE KITS were an enigmatic, art-leaning minimalist punk quartet that operated on the periphery of New York\u2019s late \u201970s no wave scene\u2014their first show was actually on a May 1979 bill with the similarly-disposed (and also debuting) UT, two strange and striking flowers simultaneously sprouting from the same overgrown garden plot. It turned out to be an incredibly short-lived project (six whole months and three live performances), with a legacy that has largely survived through the web of what its members would later go onto to do, namely vocalist Angela Jaeger relocating to London and joining DROWNING CRAZE and PIGBAG after STARE KITS\u2019 split and drummer Amy Rigby forming the SHAMS in the late \u201980s before a lauded singer/songwriter career. This LP marks the first proper STARE KITS release, with Side A pulled from live tracks recorded at two of the band\u2019s three gigs at the Lower Manhattan post-punk/experimental music hub Tier 3 and rehearsal versions of six of those eight songs making up the flip. The raw, feral energy of the live takes gives them an almost universal edge here\u2014\u201c\u200bIf It\u2019s Red It Can\u2019t Be Black\u201d is STARE KITS at their most classically no wave, as Angela\u2019s vocals waver somewhere between spoken, sung, and incanted over a completely tumbling and halting rhythm, while the doomed guitar-and-poetry intensity of \u201cI See Them From My Window\u201d almost prefigures MECCA NORMAL, and standout \u201cStrength Accumulate\u201d strips bass-driven, UK DIY-style post-punk to an absolutely paper-thin extreme. A footnote in the grand scheme of things, to be sure, but still one worth investigating. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Feeding Tube / Negative Glam Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Twenty One Children Ice Cube EP Scrappy, hook-driven punk rock with garage energy and a sneering attitude. TWENTY ONE CHILDREN balance raw distortion with catchy songwriting, keeping things loose but memorable. The EP moves fast, loaded with youthful frustration and sharp humor, recalling classic underground punk while still sounding fresh. A solid reminder that simple punk done right still hits hard. Punk rock directo y pegadizo, con energ\u00eda garage y actitud burlona. TWENTY ONE CHILDREN combinan distorsi\u00f3n cruda con canciones memorables, manteniendo todo simple pero efectivo. El EP avanza r\u00e1pido, cargado de frustraci\u00f3n juvenil y humor \u00e1cido, evocando el punk underground cl\u00e1sico sin sonar pasado de moda. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Slovenly Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Wax Static Wasted Town EP The cover is a picture of a broken skateboard with the band name in \u201990s labelmaker font, and there\u2019s a PRIMITIVE HEARTS cover included. I love it when a band lets you know exactly what to expect from their cover art. There\u2019s a lo-f surfy element to these songs, but it\u2019s still a little tough while still being fun. Both \u201cWasted Town\u201d and \u201cBack to You\u201d have an early BLACK LIPS feel to them and pair well with the PRIMITIVE HEARTS cover. The vocals are much more audible and in the mix than on their demo released in early 2025, and it benefits them well. Worth checking out if you\u2019re into lo-fi bedroom garage punk. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Blank Step Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Yellow Ghoul Yellow Ghoul cassette Solid five-track debut from Buffalo punks YELLOW GHOUL, featuring grimy and lo-fi(-ish) guitars accompanied by pounding drums and vocals by SCIENCE MAN\u2019s John Toohill. YELLOW GHOUL speeds through these songs, slowing down for a breakdown or two but not much else. Overall, I have no complaints here; this sounds like something Toxic State would put out, which is as high a compliment as I can pay. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Swimming Faith Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 V/A Slice of Death cassette Tennessee Cold Cuts have had one hell of a busy year, dropping some of the best albums I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reviewing over these last 365 days. This comp will give you a great taste of what this label has to offer, with tracks ranging from egg-punk to goth rock, dance punk to brutal grindcore. This is a fantastically eclectic mix and definitely worth a couple plays. Tennessee\u2019s punk scene is looking mighty strong heading into 2026. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Tennessee Cold Cuts Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Angel Face Out in the Street LP If you\u2019re a fan of garage punk and this isn\u2019t already on your radar, then no, you\u2019re not. Distributed via the gold standard Slovenly and featuring members of TEENGENERATE and the FADEAWAYS, this exemplifies what makes the genre exciting. The hooks are incredible and the production presents the whole affair within crackling gritty trappings. These players have power pop chops for decades, but they\u2019re so tuned in here and pushed into the red that they have major teeth track to track. Background \u201cooh\u201ds and \u201cahh\u201ds are guiding stars of style, as well as handclaps that inflect a bubblegum tone that bumps nicely against the spikier edges of what\u2019s going on. This group\u2019s debut was good stuff, but this is a whole other level. The B-side standout \u201cPress Your Luck\u201d has STOOGES\u2019 dripping venom with a chorus that\u2019s downright gorgeous. The album is undeniable, so don\u2019t try and fight it off and let it take over your turntable. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Slovenly Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Banda Des Femer Her\u00e8ncia Enverinada 12\u2033 It\u2019s the first time I get assigned a band singing in Menorcan Catalan, which is a specific type of Catalan from the Balearic Islands, and if the language is new to me, the music certainly is not, because BANDA DES FEMER play good old raw, k\u00e4ng-influenced hardcore punk that takes no prisoners and gets straight to the point. What sets this LP apart might be the peculiar production that keeps things deceptively simple and primitive\u2014it doesn\u2019t go for any deafening \u201cwall of noise\u201d or anything fancy, but just old school D-beat punk for the punks (a noble cause indeed). The band clearly displays self-awareness about the genre and their own technical prowess, which I find quite refreshing. I like the upfront vocals that are still intelligible, and there are some welcome mid-paced moments and even a couple of sing-alongs. There are strong hints of \u201990s D-beat and some songs would have been at home on a Distortion Records compilation in 1994. The music also reminds me of DHK for its spontaneity and its radicalism, not synonymous with extremity here but of core value. Simple, fast, and loud political hardcore punk that loves DISCHARGE lovers. However, I think the record should have been longer, as seven songs in fourteen minutes is a little short for an album (although the three members do not live in the same town, so practicing has to be an issue), but these are fourteen good minutes. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Diy Kontraatak / Korc Edicions / Plastic Wound / Todo Roto / Wrong Disk / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 [Brick] Demo 2025 cassette Visceral and vitriolic, the UK\u2019s [BRICK] are angry and have good reason to be. Existing in a world that rejects you at every turn is unimaginable, but that is indeed their reality. As a group of trans women (who met at a transfeminist book club, awesome), [BRICK]\u2019s songs speak to the very real hate faced by trans people every day. Sonically, it\u2019s a lo-fi and straightforward punk affair, occasionally going off the rails into discordant noise territory. Lyrically, it\u2019s a brutal listen, but one that deserves to be heard. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Covids Pay No Mind LP The COVIDS have an UNDERTONES quality to their songs while drawing in a more modern song structure influenced by Goner Records\u2019 roster of catchier bands, the Rev. N\u00f8rb, and bands blending the METHADONES and RAMONES. \u201cWaste of Space\u201d is my favorite track on the record simply because of the way they cadence the chorus of \u201cspace and time\u201d with space and time; it will make sense when you hear it. There are ten songs rounding out this LP, making this a perfect length. I think I\u2019m most pleased by the front and back of the sleeve because it gives you a near-perfect idea of what this band is like just by the color and composition, and the sunglasses on the back made me giggle. Reviewer Tony Party Label Wap Shoo Wap Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Drags Dragsploitation\u2026 Now! LP One of three well-deserved DRAGS reissues delivered by Total Punk this year, Dragsploitation\u2026 Now! is a brief and potent ride through the band\u2019s legendary \u201960s-fueled punk swagger in its earlier stages. Originally released as a 10\u201d by Estrus in 1995, this was their sophomore effort following the iconic I Like to Die 7\u201d. Alongside the MAKERS, THEE HEADCOATS, and a handful of others, these guys forged the throwback garage style of the \u201990s, offering an eye-opening take on punk for impressionable youth of that era (including yours truly.) Dig that crazy beat\u2014it still feels fresh 30 years later. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Total Punk Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Endless Joy Endless Joy LP Iron Lung hits the mark once again, delivering another masterclass in abrasive, high-stakes hardcore. ENDLESS JOY plays with tension and dissonance like a weapon\u2014jagged riffs, frantic delivery, and a suffocating, anxious energy that never lets up. Every song feels like it\u2019s on the verge of imploding, yet the band maintains complete control, which is exactly what makes it so powerful. Easily one of the strongest releases of the batch. Iron Lung no falla, y este LP es otra prueba de su punter\u00eda quir\u00fargica. ENDLESS JOY ejecuta un hardcore desquiciado, tenso y abrasivo, donde la disonancia funciona como motor emocional. Los temas avanzan como un enjambre el\u00e9ctrico: r\u00e1pidos, inc\u00f3modos y llenos de esquinas filosas. Todo suena al borde del colapso pero siempre bajo control, lo que lo vuelve a\u00fan m\u00e1s poderoso. Uno de los discos m\u00e1s fuertes del mes. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Fuzz Bombers The Fuzz Bombers cassette reissue The FUZZ BOMBERS were a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-them San Gabriel Valley band active circa 1998, built from ex-members of the JAWAS and future members of the TAKEDOWNS and BAD MOTIVATOR, among others\u2014basically the extended universe of singer/label-runner Brian Von Wolfe. This tape pulls together two sessions from that year, and the results are classic no-budget garage punk: fast, loose, and sounding slightly better than recorded-on-a-boombox. There\u2019s an early version of \u201cGet Out Of,\u201d later re-recorded by the TAKEDOWNS, but this one is faster and a shade more raw. None of this rewrites the genre playbook, but it\u2019s a perfectly decent document of late-\u201990s punk ephemera. Maybe essential if you\u2019re trying to fill out the Brian-adjacent family tree; otherwise, it\u2019s probably not going to have a huge impact on anybody. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Wolf on a Bridge Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 High Anxiety Your Dreams Are Caught in War 12\u2033 HIGH ANXIETY from Ontario, Canada plays crust-blown anarcho-punk, and earlier this year, they released Your Dreams Are Caught in War , which is ten tracks of indignation and rage. Espousing post-crust and proto-grind elements, HIGH ANXIETY features noisy vocals, upfront, dirty bass, and guitar riffs that are primitive, rhythmic, and energetic. Lyrically, HIGH ANXIETY cuts through the bullshit with scathing criticisms of political, cultural, and religious institutions of our time. The ten songs on this disc are over in much too short of an amount of time, leading to multiple playthroughs. Your Dreams are Caught in War is a joint release of Fiadh Productions and Violet Hour Transmissions, so the sleeve and disc are of the highest quality. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Fiadh Productions / Violet Hour Transmissions Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Icks Devil cassette Second five-song cassette released by this Florida three-piece punk outfit. Similar to the first tape, this follow-up is almost painfully lo-fi. Unfortunately, this does detract a bit from the songs, making it difficult to discern exactly what\u2019s going on. While I find the attempt to do an analog recording right onto a stereo tape deck incredibly commendable (and a hell of a lot more real than doing a crummy cell-phone-recorded demo), there is a learning curve and obvious limitations with such an approach. In terms of the songs themselves, the first three are driving, mid-tempo grunge-inspired punk songs with somewhat lazy vocal delivery, \u201cNice Things\u201d being the clear standout of the bunch. From here, the tape changes lanes completely, bringing us an artistic, quirky spoken word/bass interlude, and finally an acoustic, open-mic-style bedroom pop song. All in all, I\u2019m just left more confused than anything else after listening to this release. Oh, also, having to do research to figure out that a release is on a tape label is a bizarre move. Why wouldn\u2019t the label releasing something just put their label name somewhere on the tape or the artwork? Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Ragdoll Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Jailcell Recipes Artifact for an Empty Tank World LP A reissue compilation encompassing the first two full-lengths and first two EPs from hardcore Wiganers JAILCELL RECIPES. The target for this collection was to clean up poor-quality old recordings to be introduced amongst a teeming new audience. Did it work? Yes, it did. The traversing collection starts with the band in their heavily YOUTH OF TODAY-influenced genesis and ends with the band\u2019s LEATHERFACE-styled coda. Tons of material is crammed into this record sleeve, really everything there could be to know about these blokes. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label First Strike Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Knotwork Knotwork demo cassette The last time I heard of a Detroit crust band was when ANGUISH released their first EP in 2009, a comparatively innocent time when the very idea of Donald Trump being president still belonged to the realm of dystopian science fiction (where it should have stayed). I cannot be said to have a large expertise in this area, but I have a\u00a0 sixth sense when it comes to quality crust and, weather permitting, am able to detect it from beyond the seas. KNOTWORK had been on my prestigious \u201cbands to watch for\u201d list, so I was genuinely excited when this demo tape finally came out. And let me tell you that I was right to be excited, and my sixth sense is as sharp as ever. If the production might be a little too raw for some\u2014as a lover of cave music, it certainly is not for me\u2014the songwriting skills of KNOTWORK are undeniable, and for a first proper recording, it is a crust tour de force. The band inhabits the stenchcore revival waters of the punk world and are not unlike modern classic bands like ALEMENT, the sadly missed ZYGOME or mid/late \u201900s INSTINCT OF SURVIVAL, meaning they have a certain flair for good crust arrangements. Basically, they keep working on the traditional old school apocalyptic metal crust sound that, if it cannot be said to be the fanciest of punk subgenres these days, still has very loyal enthusiasts ready to save on soap in order to buy the stenchcore goods. KNOTWORK also nods to the genre\u2019s forefathers like DEVIATED INSTINCT or AXEGRINDER on a couple of occasions, but the influences are overall structural, the band cannot be considered as too derivative even if they borrow liberally. There is a good mix of paces and vocal styles, which is all the more impressive since there is just one vocalist who can switch from demonic growls \u00e0 la LAST LEGION ALIVE to more traditional DETESTATION-ish \u201990s anarcho shouts. This tape is right up crust street. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Distorted Sedition / Sound of Chaos Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Laundry Bats Hangin on a String LP Behold the LAUNDRY BATS\u2014an unanticipated bastion of punk purity in these troubled times. These are the Memphis all-stars of dirt-caked rock\u2019n\u2019roll, featuring members of the OBLIVIANS and COMPULSIVE GAMBLERS, and led by the distinctly raw vocals of Abe White (MANATEEES, TRUE SONS OF THUNDER). This configuration taps into an unbridled, freewheeling spirit that unwittingly touches edges with the likes of the RETAIL SIMPS and even Bloomington\u2019s enigmatic COWBOYS, swinging from soulful \u201970s blues rock \u00e0 la Kill City (\u201cBizness\u201d) to psychedelic spaghetti western (\u201cLawnmower Man\u201d) in impressively graceful fashion. You\u2019ll throw your hands in the air at the haunting and sympathetic \u201cChurch of Bad,\u201d and nod in approval as \u201cNightmare\u201d reappropriates the lead riff from the CLASH\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s My Name\u201d like it was a stolen catalytic converter welded onto a rusted Camaro. That\u2019s not the only familiar groove you\u2019ll find here, but any similarities to other songs living or dead are undoubtedly in tasteful homage. It\u2019s a diversely inspired party of a record, with the only constant being that it\u2019s 100% fire. Reviewer Jason Harding Label HoZac Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Lo and Behold Onward Journey cassette Debut release from LO AND BEHOLD, the solo project of Louis Harding. In a list of bands too long to name, Harding\u2019s tenure as a songwriter really shines through on this heartfelt, ten-track masterpiece. I recognized his name from his bass work in BELGRADO, whose 2023 Intra Apogeum made quite a splash. That said, there\u2019s no synth/dance vibe present on Onward Journey , instead we get a beautiful, sweeping reverie, reminiscent of the shimmering guitar and despair on something like Paul Westerberg\u2019s \u201cAnswering Machine\u201d\u2014trading Midwestern sensibilities for downcast British shoe-scuffing. This will make my top ten albums of the year, easy. I just hope the cassettes are quality, because unlike many raucous, lo-fi recordings, this one wants to be listened to loud and clear. Buy the ticket, take the Journey . Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Gob Nation / Inscrutable Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Manks Last New Wave Hero!!!!!! CD Japan\u2019s the MANKS ran from 1994\u20132001 as part of the Chiba punk scene, and Last New Wave Hero!!!!!!! collects eight tracks of their extremely lo-fi garage/\u201977-style punk, pulled from demos and compilation appearances recorded thirty years ago. It\u2019s raw, unvarnished, recorded-in-the-basement rock delivered with a bratty, high-energy sneer. \u201cMy Generation\u201d might be the highlight for me, although at 2:52, it\u2019s the longest song on the collection and probably could\u2019ve been trimmed. It all falls into that wonderfully sloppy zone where there\u2019s way more spirit than technical finesse, but I think the potential really shines through. Members later went on to the SPIT, the PLASTERS, and, more recently, SPIT-TN, but this CD captures the scrappy origin point and it\u2019s better than it has any right to be. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Private Scandal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Optic Sink Lucky Number LP Tennessee\u2019s OPTIC SINK delivers eight synth-driven post-punk tracks with their LP Lucky Number . While thoughtfully layered drum machine beats and bass lines akin to Peter Hook\u2019s melodic style form a strong foundation for the album, analog and unpolished synth tracks provide a nice, gritty top layer for Natalie Hoffmann of NOTS to sing over. Though not as front and center, guitars help strengthen the melodic content significantly. All in all, it\u2019s a nice album to sway along and wander off. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label Feel It Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dre Perish Criminal Ghost LP Rootsy collection of noisy, melodic rock songs steeped in Southern gothic and reverb that might appeal to fans of the GUN CLUB or the DRIN. Criminal Ghost is not bad by any means, but it definitely follows a more traditionally structured mainstream rock music approach than punk, although some of these tracks do have a smoky post-punk skeleton inside the meticulous production. DRE has a full-throated singing voice with a bluesy warble that registers somewhere between Win Butler of the ARCADE FIRE and Jeffrey Lee Pierce and gives the songs a lived-in sonic weight. The recording was done in New Orleans, which seems apropos, given the streetwalking at dusk vibes; I can practically smell the stale beer and cigarette smoke wafting through the lyrics, accompanied with just a touch of danger. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Strange Daisy Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Pocket Bike Racers Pocket Bike Racers demo cassette Posthumous cassette release of a two-song demo from a lo-fi, nasty, rock\u2019n\u2019roll/rockabilly-infused one-off garage punk project from Cleveland, OH, recorded in 2020 during COVID lockdown. There\u2019s something very charming about these tracks, and it is yet another of many examples from that timeframe of people finding a way to have some sort of creative outlet when isolated from others. Released in small quantities, Knuckles On Stun is onto their second run of 25 copies of this demo, with the second press having the art inverted as a differentiation from the first run of 25. Thankfully, my copy is from the first run or I would have had to photocopy my own cover, inverting it back to normal as that is a massive pet peeve of mine. Check out the recent article written for The Counterforce on that exact topic if you are confused as to what I mean. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Schenectavoidz Attaining New Levels of High cassette Straight out of Schenectady, New York, this hometown homage brings us some modern \u201cblink it and you\u2019ll miss it\u201d hardcore. To put it bluntly (no pun intended), most of these tracks don\u2019t last longer than a minute-and-a-half, besides the appropriately titled \u201c90 Seconds\u201d which abandons the lightning-quick hardcore motif and adopts a sludgier edge. These folks channel the energy of CHARLES BRONSON, but sound a bit more like fellow East Coasters EVERY TIME I DIE and SUCIDE FILE. If you\u2019re a fan of the modern hardcore sound of the last two decades, you\u2019re going to want to check this out. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Shock to the System Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Shakti Shakti LP Barcelona punk band with members of Indian heritage deliver a fucking killer debut record that captures post-colonial disillusionment so precisely that it sounds like a future rebel anthem. With Marathi-language vocals and Bollywood-influenced dancefloor rhythms, SHAKTI feels culturally rooted in India, while also existing as a seething punk band. It\u2019s an incredible, invigorating balance\u2014and the track \u201cLahan Pani,\u201d with its spoken word intro detailing the exploitation of India by countries that repair the favor with blatant racism, is maybe the year\u2019s best album opener. The bass riff is hooky, and the fury that follows is decimating. Locked-in bass/drums configurations that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a disco floor abound on this record, but it stays punk AF; not an easy feat. Songs like \u201cMaut\u201d and \u201cAndolan\u201d have a funk-anchored post-punk approach that crackles with found-sound samples, sounding like a walk past a dance club anchored by a wall of TVs displaying the same staticky news reporter. It\u2019s a rich experience, and you owe it to yourself as a connoisseur of international punk to get this on your turntable fast. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label La Vida Es Un Mus Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 So Close / Wipeout split EP Samples and powerviolence go together like a horse and a carriage. WIPEOUT delivers a seriously bass-heavy axe to the face, with a thin, can-like snare cutting through the wall of fuzz with precision, and horrific vocals setting the mood. Four tracks of modern powerviolence as short as they come that could appease both the WEEKEND NACHOS enjoyer as well as the CROSSED OUT purist. Next up is SO CLOSE, and guess what? Samples? Check! Blasts, skanks, and breakdowns? Check! More polished-sounding (if there is such a thing), INFEST-like fast hardcore delivered with the obligatory Joe Denunzio snarl. And by the time you\u2019re done reading this review, so will be the split. One for the Ham-slappers. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Drinkin' Beer in Bandana Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Starburst Revolutionary Technology cassette Harkening back to when emo was being argued over on the WEEZER message boards (during its third wave that many decried as false) is this harsh-washed gem of a tape that buries its achingly sweet harmonies in swaths of lo-fi gunk. The result is totally compelling and well-anchored to its melodies, which are uniformly excellent. Even though they get a little Midwestern on the lick starting off the penultimate cut \u201cSummer,\u201d this is a novel approach to pop-sensible indie rock with a punk ethos. Perfecto. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Rip Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 V/A This Is It\u2026 LP With every compilation I have ever heard in my entire life, I always look for several distinct things. The first being, did these bands give their best, or did they submit throwaway tracks? Second, do I get the feeling that I\u2019d want to stop into this area for lunch and record shopping? Third, and most importantly, do I want to seek out music from bands I\u2019ve never heard before? Put simply, this is the Midwest at its absolute best, styled as a variety of underground hardcore and punk to let you know that quality control and intent is paramount to the label that put this out. With seven bands, and six of them having multiple songs, this comp does its best to hack a path to uncover that raw nerve dry socket of the Great Lakes region. The record comes hammering in with CROSSES, which is essentially DIE KREUZEN, and I don\u2019t want to waste the space telling you what you already know about the staggering power of their ferocious songwriting. Up next, SEX CHANGE comes blasting in, and reminds me of a RORSCHACH, ANTISCHISM, and DROPDEAD both in style and highly charged personal lyrics. MDOP\u2019s two songs are wall-of-sound hardcore, and the recording makes me think they left some blood on the floor in that room. They are a gross rainbow of chaos and corrosive juices playing completely unhinged hardcore. The lyrics \u201cFuck this job, kill your boss,\u201d come on, who can\u2019t get behind that? KIWI ARMY brings in pop punk/power pop with melody and a homage to one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time, Silent Night Deadly Night . Similarly to how DESCENDENTS deliver an amount of level-setting to an SST compilation, KIWI ARMY mirrors that with their style of melodic punk songwriting\u2014what I mean by this is having great musicians pull in a perspective outside of aggressive id, and harnessing an everyday joy or sarcasm to round out the Side A. However, KIWI ARMY\u2019s second tune abandons the poppier punk elements with a straightforward song called \u201cThe Boring Song,\u201d and it will burrow its way into your brain and live there for the rest of your life, methinks. NO SYMPATICO might be my favorite band on here, featuring members of THEE ELDER GODS and channeling NOMEANSNO and CRUCIFUCKS while allowing ample space to be themselves. The songs mirror driving a big-engined car with a middle finger out the window, slowing down for raccoons and opossums, but heavy-footed through tweed and suit and uniform and meat and fat and muscle of certain people. PIG RIDES have members of a ton of bands you\u2019ve passed up in dollar bins or who were featured on the split 7\u201d that you bought for the other band\u2014here is your chance to hear what they\u2019ve become, and it is worth it. You get two dense hardcore songs delivered in the NEGATIVE APPROACH style of Midwestern hardcore you\u2019ve come to love. To be honest, when I heard these tracks, I pulled the needle off the record, looked them up, and ordered their cassette on December 4th, 2025 at 11:21 PM. Closing this record out is the STATE. The STATE is Michigan\u2019s longest-running hardcore band, with Jeff Bale having reviewed their No Illusions EP in Maximum Rocknroll #10 in 1983, to now, me, Maximum Rocknroll #511, in 2025. Here is the good and bad about that, nothing has changed. The STATE is still ferocious and machine-faultless in delivery. This makes for great songs with impact, but it also makes me a little bit sad that 42 years later, things are still the way they are. This compilation overwhelmingly succeeded in overcoming all three measurable points I have. I do have one challenge with this record, and it is kind of a big one for me\u2014no booklet. The insert doesn\u2019t match the power or intent of the music, and to me, it softens the full force a bit. I really love to read along with bands, and without that, I can only be partially committed. A corrective suggestion might be to have the bands send in something and plop a link to a downloadable PDF on the Bandcamp page. I dunno, I\u2019m spitballin\u2019 here. In the end, this is a fucking outstanding representation of current Middle West bands, and you\u2019d be foolish to let this pass. Reviewer Tony Party Label Back Ache Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Axe Collector Unforced Damage EP Human Future continues to prove why they\u2019re one of the most exciting labels in today\u2019s hardcore landscape. Evil-driven AXE COLLECTOR unleashes a full-force EP of ripping, steel-cut aggression: sharp riffs, collapsing-wall drums, and vocals that spit fire without a pause. Every track hits like a thrown brick\u2014fast, raw, and absolutely determined. Fury with intention, nothing sloppy, all deadly precise. Hardcore with no filler, no posturing. A record that feels urgent, necessary, alive, like it was tracked inside a street riot. One of my favorites this month. Human Future contin\u00faa demostrando por qu\u00e9 es uno de los sellos m\u00e1s emocionantes del circuito hardcore actual. Guiados por una fuerza maligna, AXE COLLECTOR entrega un EP que es pura metralla: riffs filosos, bater\u00edas que parecen detonar paredes y una voz que te escupe la realidad sin descanso. Cada tema cae como un ladrillazo\u2014r\u00e1pido, crudo, decidido. Hay furia, pero tambi\u00e9n claridad en la ejecuci\u00f3n, nada suena atolondrado, todo est\u00e1 apuntado a matar. Hardcore sin relleno, sin poses, sin descanso. Un disco que se siente urgente y necesario, como si estuviese grabado en medio de un incendio en una manifestaci\u00f3n. Uno de mis favoritos del mes. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Extinction Burst / Human Future Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Ayucaba Operaci\u00f3n Masacre LP Here\u2019s a searing debut from this Barcelona powerhouse. Featuring members of killer bands like MURO and INYECCION, the bar for this slab is quite high, but goddamn, my expectations were fully exceeded. Not unlike INYECCION, there\u2019s a prominent UK82 backbone, yet AYUCABA eschews the street punk bent for metal leanings in a BROKEN BONES kind of way. Ripping solos, chaotic, thrashy riffage \u00e0 la BLACK UNIFORMS, Operaci\u00f3n Masacre is a behemoth album. Impressive instrumentation is bolstered by straight evil vocals, launching this into a whole other galaxy. This whispered part of the opener \u201cSistema Siniestro\u201d has Sakevi vibes, and there are nods to Japanese hardcore found throughout the album\u2019s ten tracks. A potent formula executed with deftness and precision. Can\u2019t seem to keep this one off the turntable. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Metadona Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Body Minus Head An Exercise in Self-Sufficiency LP BODY MINUS HEAD hail from Kitchener, Ontario, and play a blend of hardcore and crust punk that is emotive and gnarly. On An Exercise in Self-Sufficiency , the first full-length by the band, you\u2019ll find vocal blasts that give goosebumps, guitar licks that make you say \u201chell yeah,\u201d and a rumbly rhythm section that gets your head nodding. The majority of the songs on this ten-track album are over in less than two minutes each, so you know BODY MINUS HEAD isn\u2019t wasting time noodling around, and most of the songs hit so hard you may experience shellshock. Tracks like \u201cReset to Factory Default\u201d and \u201cUnconditional\u201d are full-on sonic pummelings, while the lyrics speak truths about the failures of the human condition. If you\u2019ve ever listened to MURDERESS\u2019s The Last Thing You Will Ever See\u2026 and said to yourself, \u201cThis could be heavier and faster,\u201d then you should absolutely check out BODY MINUS HEAD. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label No Funeral Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Citric Dummies Split With Turnstile LP Minneapolis cut-ups CITRIC DUMMIES return with their fourth LP, Split With Turnstile , which\u2014consider yourself warned\u2014is not a split with TURNSTILE at all. They put up a snotty front, but all hijinks aside, across eleven high-energy songs in twenty minutes they blast out buoyant, tongue-in-cheek punk propelled by D.V. Tinner\u2019s hyperactive drumming. It\u2019s fast without tipping into hardcore, landing somewhere between the BROKEDOWNS and DEAN DIRG. My buddy Tom says parts of it sound like a less crusty ANNIHILATION TIME, and he\u2019s not wrong. Even when they\u2019re yelling \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Anything,\u201d the whole thing still bursts with this dumb, irresistible sense of fun. I fucking love this record. Immediate top ten material. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Feel It Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Die Benjamins In 10 Jahren / Pas de Deux 7\u2033 Synth-spiked German post-punk casting backwards glances to the pop-leaning (but still properly asymmetrical) side of the Neue Deutsche Welle\u2014think \u00d6STRO 430, IDEAL, NEONBABIES, etc. That was enough to pique my interest after cueing this single up with zero background context, so imagine my surprise when I clocked that DIE BENJAMINS\u2019 vocalist Annette Benjamin was the same Annette who had been the singer (and occasional saxophonist) for late \u201970s/early \u201980s femme-punk paragons HANS-A-PLAST! Her voice is as powerful as ever here, with all of the shouty defiance and boundless energy that made \u201cRank Xerox\u201d and \u201cSex Sex Sex\u201d such indelible rippers, but while these two songs are clearly informed by her musical past, they\u2019re definitely not shackled to it. Thick, distorted bass drives the quirky/arty A-side \u201cIn 10 Jahren,\u201d periodically dissolving into washes of echoing electronics straight out of the modern Leipzig school (not unlike a punchier/less coolly detached MARAUDEUR), with the darker and more desperate atmosphere of B-side \u201cPas de Deux\u201d only heightened by Annette\u2019s soaring, passionate pleads. Totally unexpected, in the best way. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Tomatenplatten Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 East End Redemption Crashing Down LP Pop punk out of Maine that combines the melodic sensibilities of your average RAMONES-core outing with a hint of early PROPAGHANDI\u2014mainly in the vocals. In other words, this sounds like it came straight from the early years of Fat Wreck Chords. Good mixture of lighthearted lyrics paired with dystopian themes, specifically with tracks like \u201cLost Town\u201d and \u201cLacking Motivation.\u201d Nothing groundbreaking here, but it really scratches that itch if you\u2019re a fan of this era of punk. I would be remiss not to mention how great the bass tone is on this here slab. Solid production all around, actually. In my research, I came across a recycling center of the same name from the same town the group calls home. I love when bands pull their monikers from shit like that. Fantastic stuff, and would recommend for a couple spins.

Slashing, bumping, \u201cTake Out the Trash\u201d runs on a noir-ish bassline, a bit of David Axelrod\u2019s cinematics or Death in Vegas\u2019 ominous dance grooves in its cowbell clanging, horn-bursting swagger.

Fourth world, indeed.

The band keeps dynamics to a gentle hush; Ammons plays his melody lines straight, keeping embellishments to a bare minimum. Still, the ear can\u2019t help but single out Ammons\u2019 tenor sax. His tone is unmistakable: deep, rich, and warm. He doesn\u2019t so much play notes as he breathes his soul into them, tinting each legato phrase with a lifetime\u2019s worth of dreams and regrets.

Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best.

In six tracks which blend seamlessly into one musical entity, this pivotal collaboration from Brian Eno and Jon Hassell explores a mystical, minimalist music, tinted by Southern Hemisphere sounds but also incorporating 20th century electronics. The cuts move slowly but insistently, a sensuous wiggle in their syncopation.

As with any good NYE party, it\u2019s equal parts awesome, boozy and occasionally chaotic. Hit play at 10:30pm on December 31 and you can time it just right to hear JJ Cale welcome you to 1976. Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together Posted on December 29, 2025 December 28, 2025 The eclectic instrumental quartet Oregon didn\u2019t have a drummer, and didn\u2019t need one, letting Collin Walcott\u2019s hand percussion punctuate their inventive collective approach to rhythm and timekeeping.

The saxophonist and bandleader joins us to discuss his beautiful LP Ancestros Futuros , out now on Daptone Records. Mining his Indigenous roots, soul jazz, and funk, it\u2019s a fantastic album, and it completes a trilogy that began with 2019\u2019s All My Relations , continued with 2021\u2019s Baca Sewa , and now concludes.

A John Waters Christmas (2004) Posted on December 16, 2025 December 11, 2025 Christmas provides the perfect setting for Waters to juxtapose with his subversive authorship: taking something cheerful, domestic, and sentimental and gleefully deforming it into tawdry anarchy. So it should come as no surprise that when New Line Records asked the cult icon to compile a Christmas album, Waters curated a track listing far off the beaten path of Bing Crosby and Andy Williams. \u201cI think a few of these songs are awful,\u201d Waters would say. \u201cBut they\u2019re so awful, they\u2019re perfect.\u201d Load More The AD Interview Lagniappe Sessions Transmissions Podcast Mixtapes Email Newsletter AD Supply Membership Search for: The AD Interview Lagniappe Sessions Transmissions Podcast Mixtapes Email Newsletter AD Supply Membership Twitter Instagram Facebook Threads Bluesky Aquarium Drunkard Membership Membership About Contact Supply Back to Top"

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
