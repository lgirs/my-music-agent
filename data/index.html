        <p>These albums scored 70-79. They didn't make the playlist but might be interesting.</p>
        <ul class="review">
            <li><b>Alex Wong - Permission</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The term 'defiant' suggests artistic value and emotional depth, aligning with your critical rule for prioritizing such descriptions. While 'sing-along anthem' could be generic, the 'defiant' aspect warrants a closer look within the pop/rock genres you occasionally enjoy.</i></span></li><li><b>Twenty One Children - Ice Cube</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: This 'scrappy, hook-driven punk rock with garage energy and a sneering attitude' balances 'raw distortion with catchy songwriting' and is 'loaded with youthful frustration'. While 'solid' and 'simple' are generic, the raw energy and frustration components warrant a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>After - After</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as 'Experimental / Electronic', which could fit your interest in innovative music, provided it avoids dance/disco and processed sounds.</i></span></li><li><b>Brahman - Breath</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as 'slow jam Doom,' which is an interesting stylistic twist on a genre you appreciate. This unique take suggests a potential for artistic novelty.</i></span></li><li><b>FAUN - Hex</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as 'Pagan folk rockers', this album fits your interest in folk and various rock subgenres. The 'Pagan' aspect suggests a unique thematic depth and potential for artistic merit, going beyond generic folk or rock. While the praise 'pretty good!' is generic, the genre blend itself warrants a manual review to assess its artistic value.</i></span></li><li><b>The Not - This Record Contains Not One Hit Single… + I Do Not Care!!!</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as 'off-kilter Japanese punkers' with 'rough-hewn tracks' and a 'quirky take on ’90s garage punk', this suggests artistic merit beyond generic punk. The 'uncharacteristically clean fidelity' is a minor concern, but the 'off-kilter' nature warrants a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Yellow Ghoul - Yellow Ghoul</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described with 'grimy and lo-fi(-ish) guitars' and 'pounding drums', and compared to what 'Toxic State would put out' (known for raw, intense hardcore/punk), this aligns with your preference for unpolished and powerful punk. The 'solid' descriptor is generic but the other elements elevate it to manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Oregon / Elvin Jones - Together</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as an 'unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes' where both parties 'branch out and sample new realms', indicating artistic experimentation and a unique fusion within the jazz genre, which you occasionally appreciate, especially when it pushes boundaries.</i></span></li><li><b>EQUILIBRIUM - Equinox</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Folk Metal and Power Metal are acceptable genres. The description 'like sitting through an epic movie that doesn’t exist' suggests a cinematic, ambitious scope and artistic narrative, which hints at artistic value beyond generic metal. Manual review is recommended to ensure it's not overly processed.</i></span></li><li><b>Ptolemea - Kali</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as an 'Alternative Rock band' and 'nothing less than interesting, and at times even bloody good.' While not explicitly using priority terms, the genre is a good fit and the general positive description suggests potential artistic merit.</i></span></li><li><b>Fungas - Intelligence 1</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: While terms like 'sci-fi egg-punk', 'DEVO-core vocals', 'herky-jerky rhythms', and 'alien synths' suggest a unique fusion, the emphasis on 'fun high-energy blast' and 'maximum party impact' slightly deprioritizes it. However, the unique description makes it worth a manual review.</i></span></li>
