And healthcare in America has become a double hit: first, the health crisis itself; second, navigating a system that can throw haymakers when you\u2019re already down. Chris J.

They inked a deal with Fearless in 2024, releasing the EP Messy Star , followed a year later by their full-length debut, Ripe Fruit Rots and Falls. \nThe core of Chokecherry lies in guitarist Izzie A.

AllMusic Staff Picks AllMusic Staff Pick \u2013 February 21, 2026 Wire Chairs Missing August, 1978 Alternative/Indie Rock Chairs Missing marks a partial retreat from Pink Flag's bare-bones minimalism, although it still takes concentrated listening to dig out some of the melodies. Producer Mike Thorne's synth adds a Brian Eno-esque layer of atmospherics, and Wire seems more concerned with the sonic textures it can coax from its instruments; the tempos are slower, the arrangements employ more detail and sound effects, and the band allows itself to stretch out on a few songs. - Steve Huey Editorial Picks for Vertical layout, Week 1 In Memoriam Chuck Negron, 1942-2026 Interviews They Shot the Piano Player: An Interview with Filmmaker Fernando Trueba Radio on the TV The Super Bowl on Shuffle Our Properties AllMusic AllMovie SideReel Site Overview New Releases Discover Articles Recommendations About What is AllMusic?

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37492 Reviews Beautiful Disaster Lily Lowe In sum, this was a fine album, as well as one that was fun to listen to. Lily\u2019s vocals power the musicians, but they also keep up nicely. Most of the songs were around three minutes, which doesn\u2019t give them album a lot of diversity, but it was fine as is. Apna Stam1na I may sound like a Finnish weeb here, but\u00a0Stam1na is just another reason why Finland is the capital of metal. Ritual Soul of Anubis I'd really like to see\u00a0Soul of Anubis tap deeper into their progressive minds and put forth another brutal album, this time with more variation. The Moment Of A Lifetime Star.Gate If you are a fan of this kind of Neoclassical Metal in general, or in this case what STAR.GATE is feeding us on \u201cThe Moment Of A Lifetime\u201d, I guess that you\u2019re in for a treat. It will be no surprise that I feel that this album will really speak to you. Why? Because everything that STAR.GATE does fits. In Shadows Deep \u2013 Shadow of the Crow Pt. II Forbidden Seed I know that \u201cIn Shadows Deep \u2013 Shadow of the Crow Pt. II\u201d is a special kind of album, one of those that will keep growing on you every time to decide to play it. And no, I don\u2019t feel that FORBIDDEN SEED is giving me something that should Rock my world, but somehow it does. Catharsis (single) 3 Headed Snake Musically you can classify 3 HEADED SNAKE  as following; take the ultimate power that a band like MALICE always portrayed, the compelling nature that JUDAS PRIEST is capable of and combine it with the vocal qualities that QUEENSR\u0178CHE is well known for. Beyond the Forest Valdrin Overall, this was an excellent album, and Black Metal has never been so rich, full, and even complex. You can tell that the band are excellent musicians, evidenced by their propensity to work outside of some of the genre boundaries, while maintaining the traditions that fans have come to expect. Dawn of the Iconoclast Worm Shepherd Breakdown Count?\u2122 Profanation's Vapor Upon The Altar If I had a nickel for each Polish black metal band I've reviewed an EP for in the past 24 hours, I'd have two nickels, and I'd probably use them to buy a third. Autumn Embrace Enisum The best part about the album was how well the artists connected visuals with the music. The song titles came to life before my eyes, and I could almost follow the tale by watching with my eyes. The album cover tells a lot about what you might find here in your listening experience\u2026hues of orange leaves tell me it\u2019s mid-fall and the mist that hangs low with mountain spires rising sharply in the background. It\u2019s an inviting scene, but also one that might be marked with danger. Will you step into the forest? The King Is Victorious Lightning Strikes While it's possible to pull off heavy metal in the current age,\u00a0\"The King Is Victorious,\"\u00a0with its Duolingo sentence-like song titles, masterbatory guitar solos, and drawn-out compositions, falls flat. Ancient Throne of Sinister Rites Astral Spear I'd like to see more from this project, so I'll be patently waiting for\u00a0Astral Spear-related news. Fragment Through Hollow Eternity Funeral Skies This was an absolutely fantastic album. Not only is the trio musically gifted at their instruments, they write melodies that are straightforward, high reaching, and just a joy to listen to. Pop this in on a long drive, and the time will pass peacefully. Rituel: Initiation De l'Ab\u00eeme Na\u00eet l'Aube This is an album that will crush your very soul, with equal helpings of death, disease, rot, and the kind of desolation that sinks into your mind and you can\u2019t crawl out of. Once its blackness reaches you, its grip is firm, and can\u2019t be broken. A warning\u2026if you are already feeling bad, this is not the cure. Depths of the Grave Denounced Disgraced Lollipops! Nothing Happened Here Echoes of Amara / Sincerely Yours \"Nothing Happened Here\"\u00a0is a small but mighty sampler to sink your teeth into once your Valentine's Day sweets are gone. The All Seeing Eye Pollard Row Overall, this was an excellent album. At times, it was shrouded in mystery, while at others, the music was right in your face. Even in the latter times, the music has a darkness to it that is hard to describe, but it attracted me like a moth to flame. Wings of the Nightstorm (Reissue) Thus Defiled Whereas the musical style definitely is Black Metal, THUS DEFILED aren\u2019t afraid to venture out into Thrash and/or Heavy metal territory when the songs demand it. That is where the real power lies within THUS DEFILED. Latest Interviews All 2132 Interviews Markus Lachendro Xfactor1 I took some time recently and sat down with Markus Lachendro, guitarist for the band [\u2026] Micha\u0142 Chro\u015bcielewski, Pawe\u0142 Smarkusz, Monika Chro\u015bcielewska CZART CZART is an experimental metal band hailing from Poland. The concept behind their debut album, \u201cCzarty Polskie,\u201d has been controversial not only for the AI debate but for the many references to Polish demonology. On All Hallows Eve, Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with members of CZART to discuss everything from AI to the reasons why metal resonates so much in Poland to whether we are living in the best of times or the worst. Most importantly, they discuss the beloved CZART goat. Sam Graff Agenbite Misery AGENBITE MISERY hails from New Hampshire.

On October 10, 2025, the trio for Ashville, North Carolina release their fifth full-length album, \"Sunsetter,\" via Terminus Hate City.

After two thrashy, pummeling tracks, \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d slows the pace and ups the atmosphere, doling out chunky riffs and creepy leads. Its name aptly captures its role on Blood Mountain , feeling like the stirrings of an album (and a band) with gigantic aspirations. Speaking of slow risers, Iceland\u2019s Sleeping Giant has finally roused for their first LP after forming in 2006.\u201d Giant-sized shoes to fill. Bizarrekult \u2013 Alt Som Finnes Review By Dr. A.N. Grier on February 20, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 40 comments \u201cIf you know anything about grumpy ole Grier , you know he\u2019s been dry-humping Bizarrekult ever since 2021\u2019s Vi Overlevde . \u201cDry-humping\u201d might not be the correct term. Maybe passionate lovemaking? Yeah, that\u2019s the stuff. But, in all seriousness, this little band came out of nowhere and has been making waves in such a short time. While the debut had me glued to my seat, the follow-up, Den Tapte Krigen , damn-near bolted me down\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the point that I had to cut myself out of my pants to break free. If that had been the band\u2019s swansong, I would have been just fine for the rest of my life. But Bizarrekult is back to ruin another pair of my pants. Behold! Alt Som Finnes !\u201d Weird kvlt fandom. Madness on the High Seas: AMG Elders Brave 70000 Tons of Metal By Steel Druhm on February 20, 2026 in Blog Posts , 47 comments Steel Druhm summarizes his experiences on the recent 70000 Tons of Metal Cruise while downplaying and concealing crimes committed in international waters. Misotheist \u2013 De Pinte Review By Grin Reaper on February 19, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 36 comments \u201cEver shrouded in mystery, the enigmatic collective Misotheist emerges from their icy realm to deliver succor to fans of metals black and arcane. De Pinte , the band\u2019s fourth release, roughly translates from Norwegian to \u2018The Tormented\u2019 or \u2018They Tormented,\u2019 a fitting appellation given the Trondheim troupe\u2019s fondness for tortured topics and twisted themes.\u201d Miso kvlt! Domhain \u2013 In Perfect Stillness Review By Steel Druhm on February 19, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 47 comments \u201cFor the second review in a row, I heard about a band via skimming YouTube, heard something I liked, and tracked down their promo. I\u2019m used to working this from the other direction, but when the almighty algorithm gives, one must take and be thankful. Domhain is an atmospheric post-black metal band from Northern Ireland, and In Perfect Stillness is their debut full-length. With an emotionally charged sound and style, Domhain touches on the past works of Darkest Era , Primordial , and Agalloch while utilizing cellos and haunting female vocals to punctuate the melancholic, often grim moods they wallow in.\u201d Dashed upon the Reefs of Grief. Nytt Land \u2013 Aba Khan Review By Spicie Forrest on February 19, 2026 in Reviews , Folk , Not Metal , 23 comments \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to share my favorite fact about Nytt Land , the Siberian dark folk project from husband and wife, Anatoly and Natalia Pakhalenko. During my research for this review, I came across an old interview with Anatoly. He was discussing instrumental diversity on their then-upcoming release, ODAL . Of all the instruments Anatoly plays, the talharpa, an ancient Nordic bowed lyre, is his favorite. Do you know why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his favorite? BECAUSE HIS WIFE MADE IT FOR HIM. MADE IT. WITH HER OWN TWO HANDS.\u201d DIY for REAL. Sylosis \u2013 The New Flesh Review By Lavender Larcenist on February 18, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Metalcore , Thrash Metal , 35 comments \u201c Sylosis has been quietly plugging along in the background for years, a band that, in my anecdotal experience, many have heard of, but few listen to. When I go to shout about the greatness of albums like Monolith or Dormant Heart from the highest peaks, it seems to fall on deaf ears. No more, I say! Lead vocalist and guitarist Josh Middleton has led the band since Edge of the Earth . As the last remaining original member, he became the de facto songwriter and soul of a group that has seen many members over the years and near dissolution during Middleton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time with Architects . After returning to Sylosis full-time, the band is on their third release in this latest era, The New Flesh .\u201d All hail the new flesh! Desoration \u2013 NON Review By Owlswald on February 18, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Melodic Death Metal , Technical Death Metal , 22 comments \u201cSelf-releasing an album is a monumental effort. Between production, distribution, artwork, press, yadda yadda yadda, the logistical weight quickly consumes vast amounts of time, money and energy. And that\u2019s before you factor in the arduous task of creating music that\u2019s actually fucking good. Indeed, for a young band, initial encounters are everything, which means it behooves one to ensure everything is as polished and professional as possible. Desoration understands this\u201d Self against self. Shine \u2013 Wrathcult Review By Grin Reaper on February 17, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Blackened Death Metal , Death Metal , 11 comments \u201cSomething must be in the water over in Poland, because the country churns out quality death metal like few others. The phrase \u2018Polish death metal\u2019 always grabs my attention, whether it\u2019s technical like early Decapitated , thrashy \u00c3\u00a0 la Vader , or as blackened as Behemoth . Such was the case when I espied Shine \u2019s Wrathcult lying unclaimed in the promo bin.\u201d Hiding light under a cult bushel. Phasma \u2013 Purgatory Review By Kenstrosity on February 17, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Metal , Deathcore , Hardcore , Technical Death Metal , 34 comments \u201cSometimes an album comes around ye olde promo pit that looks and smells familiar, but plays like something else entirely. Today\u2019s entry into the \u201cwhat the heck am I actually listening to?\u201d hall of infamy is Phasma \u2019s Purgatory . The third record from the Greek/US duo, and the first carried by a label\u00e2\u0080\u0094our beloved Transcending Obscurity Records\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Purgatory continually subverted every expectation I had. In doing so, it became one of my biggest pleasant surprises in recent memory.\u201d Set Phasmas to brutal stun.

And yet, mutual aid remains a vital resource for oppressed people the world over. Some say punk shouldn\u2019t be political, and to that I say two things.

HUMAN GREED displays their reverence for old school grind while also completely reinvigorating the genre by introducing contemporary sounds and compositions.

Last spring saw the release of Tr\u00e9sor Magn\u00e9tique , the latest posthumous compilation highlighting the works of Cameroonian musicologist, writer, composer, and broadcaster Francis Bebey. Culled from Bebey\u2019s seemingly endless archives by his son Patrick, the collection unearths deep cuts spanning 1974 to 1986. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Wet Tuna :: Vast The musical and psychic evolution of Matt \u201cMV\u201d Valentine traces a wide-ranging and gloriously unwieldy trajectory through sound and space for those intrepid enough to follow it. Spanning the earliest days of Tower Recordings, a bevy of solo albums, one of the most exhaustive and rewarding live recording archives you can dig into, and twenty-five years copiloting the fantastic voyage of MV&EE, Valentine has never stopped pushing the music outward and onward. And it doesn\u2019t get any farther out than the freewheeling funkified flights of Wet Tuna. Read More Spotify Apple Music Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close SOYUZ :: KROK Tracked live to tape at Sessa and Biel Basile\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo studio, Krok captures the Belarusian outfit in a moment of transition, stretching the sinewy tendrils of their earlier work into something more expansive and self-possessed. Where their previous LP steeped itself in the gentle saudade of Brazil\u2019s Clube da Esquina, Krok pulls the lens back as the palette broadens and horizons turn transcontinental. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Joshua Massad & Dylan Aycock :: Two Improvisations More stunning Takoma School ragas from Joshua Massad and Dylan Aycock, whose self-titled 2020 cassette has been in constant rotation over the past few years. This one is the duo\u2019s vinyl debut \u2014 and as the title tells us, we\u2019re invited to luxuriate in two long improvs, both stretching well beyond the 15-minute mark. Read More Spotify Apple Music Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Naujawanan Baidar :: Volume 1 Posted on February 19, 2026 February 19, 2026 Like a \u201967 Velvets drone crackling from a battery-powered transistor radio beneath the Afghan sky, Naujawanan Baidar\u2019s debut cassette evokes a world unto itself. Isolated, resonant, and strangely infinite. Recorded straight to 4-track and released in 2018 via the Netherlands-based label Radio Khiyaban, the 40-minute transmission unfolds like a sub rosa broadcast from another time, as its lo-fi textures and meditative pacing draw the listener into a furtive, half-remembered landscape where the past and present blur into one. Zal Yanovsky :: Alive And Well In Argentina Posted on February 19, 2026 February 19, 2026 Following his departure as lead guitarist of The Lovin\u2019 Spoonful, Alive And Well In Argentina is the curious one-off solo offering from Canadian folk-rock musician Zal Yanovsky. Released in 1968, the record is dripping with sardonic irony from the title and artwork to the ingrained comedy of the originals and covers scattered throughout. Such a novelty hodgepodge (think Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band or the Firesign Theatre) nonetheless includes admirable takes on country and western classics from the likes of Floyd Cramer and George Jones, while other originals present an obtusely frenzied psychedelia with Yanovsky\u2019s unmistakably charismatic touch. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on February 18, 2026 February 15, 2026 Pac\u00edfico Nocturno. Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W SOYUZ :: KROK Posted on February 18, 2026 February 18, 2026 Tracked live to tape at Sessa and Biel Basile\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo studio, Krok captures the Belarusian outfit in a moment of transition, stretching the sinewy tendrils of their earlier work into something more expansive and self-possessed. Where their previous LP steeped itself in the gentle saudade of Brazil\u2019s Clube da Esquina, Krok pulls the lens back as the palette broadens and horizons turn transcontinental. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0446\u044b \u0414\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 :: \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0446\u044b \u0414\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 Posted on February 18, 2026 February 17, 2026 Hailing from Izhevsk, Russia, Samsti Dronta (English translation: Male Dodos) played their first live gig in that fateful year 1991. By all accounts they inhaled contemporary Western influences like Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, and Dead Can Dance. They excavated sounds from industrial materials such as sheet metal and glass. The output from these experiments could have resulted in something harsh, but the sharp edges are balanced with gauzy and beautiful moments. Bill Fay :: From The Bottom Of An Old Grandfather Clock (A Collection Of Demos And Outtakes 1966-1970) Posted on February 17, 2026 February 18, 2026 If you blinked, you might have missed it. Dead Oceans quietly re-released From the Bottom of an Old Grandfather Clock last December\u2014a twenty-five-track journey through Bill Fay\u2019s back pages, loaded with demos and long-forgotten outtakes. Having largely disappeared from public life after the release of 1971\u2019s Time of the Last Persecution , only to reemerge in a quietly triumphant late-career renaissance in 2012, the collection stands as a worthy and necessary addition to the English singer-songwriter and pianist\u2019s enduring oeuvre. Stephen McCraven :: Wooley The Newt Posted on February 17, 2026 February 16, 2026 Originally released on Marion Brown\u2019s Sweet Earth imprint in 1979, Wooley The Newt is a true lost spiritual jazz relic from percussionist and composer Stephen McCraven. Resurrected in a limited capacity by British reissue label Moved-By-Sound at the tail end of last year, the record was sampled by Stephen\u2019s son Makaya on his 2020\u2019s reimaging of Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s I\u2019m New Here . Recorded in Paris and more than long overdue, it\u2019s a fascinating relic of seventies avant-jazz and a lost bandleader debut of the utmost artistic craft. Lala Lala :: Heaven 2 Posted on February 17, 2026 February 16, 2026 Heaven 2 is a road album of sorts, where the Chicago songwriter breaks out for fresh territories. Whether toward or away from something is anybody\u2019s guess. What keeps things real, what keeps them compelling, is the cigarette-ash astringency of LaLa LaLa\u2019s central melodies.\u00a0No matter how far she drives from the big city, her songs will, perhaps, always have a tough urban grit to them. John Renbourn :: Live In Kyoto 1978 Posted on February 16, 2026 February 16, 2026 Recorded during the second of two nights John Renbourn played at Kyoto\u2019s Jittoku Coffeehouse, Live in Kyoto 1978 captures the guitarist in a moment of intimacy and precision. Poised and unhurried, the set finds Renbourn relaxed, patiently threading his repertoire before a hushed, attentive room. A baker\u2019s dozen, these recordings were captured on site by audio archivist Satoro Fujii and unearthed forty years later in 2018 via Drag City. Tucker Zimmerman: In Memoriam (1941-2026) Posted on February 16, 2026 February 15, 2026 On January 17, 2026, the world lost the great Tucker Zimmerman and his wife of more than fifty years, Marie-Claire, to a house fire in Liege, Belgium. He was 84 years old. Though born in the United States, he had been a resident of Europe since 1966. A novelist, poet, folk singer, classical composer, & electronic musician, Zimmerman had a deep and restless career with more than a dozen albums to his name. However, because of his status as an expat, he was largely overlooked in his birth country for most of his lifetime. Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard :: February 2026 Posted on February 15, 2026 February 11, 2026 Freeform transmissions from Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard on dublab. Airing every third Sunday of the month, RFAD on dublab features the pairing of Tyler Wilcox\u2019s Doom and Gloom from the Tomb and Chad DePasquale\u2019s New Happy Gathering. This month, Tyler kicks it off with a mix of recent instrumental favorites, and Chad follows it up with a Valentine\u2019s mix \u2014 broken, belated, and bewildered!\u00a0Sunday, 4-6pm PT. The Elegance of Longing: Prefab Sprout\u2019s Steve McQueen and Jordan: The Comeback Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 There are albums that shimmer with impossible ambition, records that sound like they were beamed in from some parallel dimension where pop music never surrendered its claim to sophistication. In the mid-to-late 1980s, while synthesizers ruled the airwaves and production grew increasingly bombastic, Paddy McAloon was writing songs of such disarming tenderness and linguistic agility that they seemed to exist outside time entirely. With Thomas Dolby\u2019s production expertise, Prefab Sprout created two albums \u2013 Steve McQueen in 1985 and Jordan: The Comeback in 1990 \u2013 that stand as monuments to what pop music can achieve when intelligence and emotion strike up a perfect balance. Tommy Hendrix :: Out Of The Mist (1958) Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 Out Of The Mist (1958) is the lone trace of Tommy Hendrix, a cool-jazz crooner whose biography begins and ends with a solitary release. It\u2019s an obscure album lost to time by an artist who seemingly never existed. Tommy Hendrix is a midcentury ghost, and Out Of The Mist is the sound of his specter briefly passing through our dimension, like a puff of cigarette smoke lingering in a cocktail lounge that nobody has ever set foot in.
