    "album": "Grievances",
    "relevance_score": 95,
    "decision": "LIKE_IMMEDIATELY",
    "reasoning": "The description of Rolo Tomassi's 'Grievances' highlights an 'innovative approach' to combining 'heavy hardcore' and 'calm math-rockish sound' with 'experimentation galore', 'complex polyrhythmic work', and 'beautifully awkward gaps'. The ability to transition between these faces to form a 'frantic/beautiful cohesive whole' strongly aligns with your critical rule for innovation, artistic challenge, emotional depth, and unique fusion. The genres (hardcore, punk, math rock) are also well within your preferred taste, and the band's experimental nature connects with the vibe of artists you like such as Converge, Oranssi Pazuzu, and festivals like ArcTanGent."
