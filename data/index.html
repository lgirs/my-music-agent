Sounds raw and energetic, but doesn't explicitly hit the 'innovation' or 'emotional depth' critical criteria for a higher score, thus warrants a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Various Artists - So High I've Been: A European Rock Anthology 1967-1973</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: This compilation of psychedelia and progressive rock from a specific era could offer artistic inspiration and fits within the broader rock genres you enjoy (e.g., Oranssi Pazuzu, Mogwai). While not explicitly innovative, its historical context and genre relevance make it worth a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Unexpectance - Solus Ipse</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The album is noted for 'tapping similar Dante-centric philosophical wells for its theme,' suggesting artistic ambition and intellectual depth, which aligns with your criteria for music with artistic value and merit.</i></span></li><li><b>Omnium Gatherum - May The Bridges We Burn Light Our Way</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Omnium Gatherum is well-known for melodic death metal, fitting your 'extreme metal' and 'various sub genres of rock and metal' criteria. While no descriptive text is provided for this album, the artist's genre is a strong enough match to warrant manual review as a high-priority artist.</i></span></li><li><b>An Abstract Illusion - The Sleeping City</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Known for progressive melodic death metal with atmospheric elements, this band fits your 'extreme metal' criteria and your interest in progressive/atmospheric sounds (like Oranssi Pazuzu or Deafheaven).

However, 'symphonic and melodic Metal' can sometimes imply a highly produced sound, warranting a manual review to ensure it avoids your 'highly processed' criteria.</i></span></li><li><b>Mon Rovîa - Bloodline</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Genre is 'Folk/Country', which is a stated interest (americana, Will Varley, Jason Isbell). Lacks further description, so a manual review is appropriate.</i></span></li><li><b>Bulgarian State Radio & Television Female Vocal Choir - Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Genre is 'Folk/Country'.

Pruz - Red sky at morning</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Genre is 'Folk/Country', a direct match for your interests. Lacks specific descriptors for higher score, so a manual review is suitable.</i></span></li><li><b>Redivider - Sounds Of Malice</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: While the genre is Death Metal (which you like), the description primarily focuses on 'faultless,' 'hard,' 'heavy,' and 'transparent and very clear' production, which doesn't strongly indicate the artistic depth or innovation you prioritize. It's not negative, but not glowing either, warranting a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Urne - Setting Fire To The Sky</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The description mentions the band showing 'different sides of themselves,' suggesting some artistic range. However, the praise 'a lot of quality' is generic and doesn't strongly highlight innovation or emotional depth, thus requiring a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>FAUN - Hex</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The 'Pagan folk rockers' genre description is an interesting and potentially unique fusion that aligns with your occasional interest in folk and rock, suggesting artistic merit beyond generic rock. However, the descriptor 'pretty good!' is generic.</i></span></li><li><b>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy - HEAVY</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The explicit 'HEAVY' description and the band name strongly suggest a style (likely sludge/post-metal/noise rock) that aligns with your preferences for heavy, impactful music, similar to Chat Pile or Primitive Man. The brevity of the review prevents a higher score, but the tone is not generic praise.</i></span></li><li><b>Creeper - Sanguivore II</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Creeper's punk rock/goth punk style aligns with your interest in punk rock and alternative rock, and artists like Bad Religion and The Cure.

The comparison, 'Could be Mark Arm’s cousin singing', links it to a favoured grunge artist (Mudhoney). While some terms are generic, the fuzzy, bluesy garage punk and Mark Arm reference warrant a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Ov Sulfur - Endless</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: As a deathcore album, it aligns with extreme metal, and the thematic hint of 'horrors in the world' could indicate emotional depth or intensity, which is a positive sign, though the description is brief.</i></span></li>

Although less 'crust monster' than before, the music is 'still as fast and punishing, the vocals as anguished and extreme, the unstoppable D-beat noize has not disappeared'. The band 'experiments with paces a little', indicating artistic evolution and strong emotional depth, fitting your hardcore and extreme metal preferences.</i></span></li><li><b>Florence + the Machine - Everybody Scream</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 88]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Florence + the Machine generally aligns with alternative rock tastes.
