Facebook Instagram RSS Twitter Powered by Genesis Mayer\u2019s Playlist for Fall/Winter 2025, Part 1 Wednesday, December 10, 2025 By Mayer Danzig Speechwriter, Joelton Mayfield (from the Bloodshot Records release Crowd Pleaser) Joelton Mayfield\u2019s Crowd Pleaser announces itself with purpose: vivid storytelling wrapped in guitars that know when to whisper and when to scream. The dynamics shift constantly\u2014bobbing, weaving, building tension that reverberates from somewhere in the distance before crashing into the present moment. \u201cPretty Linda\u201d offers [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Americana , Pop , Reviews , Rock , Singer/Songwriter , Streams , Videos Tagged With: American Mile , Jade Bird , Joelton Mayfield , John Calvin Abney , Julianna Riolino , Silver Lining , Terra Lightfoot , Trapper Schoepp , William Prince , Zoe Pete Ford Afton Wolfe \u2013 Ophiuchus Thursday, December 04, 2025 By Shawn Underwood I\u2019ve noted before that I\u2019m a fan of concept albums. I have not seen anyone embrace it quite the way Nashville-by-way-of-Mississippi resident Afton Wolfe did on his newest record, Ophiuchus. Each of the 13 songs is associated with one of the 12 well-known signs of the zodiac, plus one for the lesser known Ophiuchus. Then, [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Folk , Reviews , Roots , Singer/Songwriter Tagged With: Afton Wolfe Peace, Twang, and Turkey Grease: A 2025 Thanksgiving Toast to Kathleen Edwards (and Everyone) Thursday, November 27, 2025 By Tom Osborne The turkey\u2019s in the oven, somebody\u2019s hiding the good bourbon, and there\u2019s at least one family member asking, \u201cWait, who is this?\u201d every time a new song comes on. Meanwhile, here in Twangville, we\u2019re doing what we always do: sharing recs, falling in love with new records, and giving thanks for the music that gets us through it all. Filed Under: Reviews Tagged With: Kathleen Edwards GA-20 \u2013 Orphans Wednesday, November 26, 2025 By Bill Wilcox About 12 years ago I caught a Charlie Musselwhite show at Blues Alley, DC\u2019s great jazz club (that occasionally features blues artists lately). Musselwhite of course was great, but the young lead guitarist, Matthew Stubbs, piqued my intrest so much I sought out his early solo albums \u2013 Soul Bender and Medford & Main.

They go to a bluegrass show to hear the performer\u2019s music, whether written by themselves or someone else. So I found it intriguing to listen to Trish Imbrogno\u2019s (aka Trish Plays Bass) debut EP. After 25 years [\u2026] Filed Under: Bluegrass , Reviews Tagged With: Trish Plays Bass The Tasty Kings \u2013 The Kindness of Numbers Thursday, November 13, 2025 By Shawn Underwood I\u2019m not a lawyer, which undoubtedly enables a number of people to sleep better at night. So the difference between a band and a collective is partially lost on me. The one thing that does seem to be the case is that it enables an easier time of rotating musicians in and out of the [\u2026] Filed Under: Reviews Tagged With: The Tasty Kings \u201cI Don\u2019t Like You\u201d \u2013 a Premiere From Low Roller Wednesday, November 12, 2025 By Mayer Danzig Longtime readers know I love a good kiss-off song.\u00a0\u201cI Don\u2019t Like You,\u201d\u00a0the title of Low Roller\u2019s new single, seems prime for the list. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s actually the opposite. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t like you, but I love you anyway,\u201d singer-songwriter Veronica Davila declares. The song recognizes that conflict can be healthy in a relationship [\u2026] Filed Under: Reviews , Streams Tagged With: Low Roller Gurf Morlix \u2013 Bristlecone Wednesday, November 05, 2025 By Rubis Corbeau With Bristlecone, Gurf Morlix once again delivers an unmistakable work\u2014painted in his palette of gothic imagery, sparse guitar, and hard-earned truth. This is the kind of album that feels like flying across Seven Mile Bridge at night in a hearse with the windows rolled down, narrowly escaping the Devil, yelling \u201cStep On it Skinner!\u201d It\u2019s [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Reviews , Singer/Songwriter Tagged With: Gurf Morlix John Francis O\u2019Mara \u2013 Forbidden Hymns Wednesday, October 29, 2025 By Shawn Underwood The United States\u2019 Bible Belt and the strongholds of American country music share a lot of geographical overlap.

And if you ask me, for a trio they are able to make a lot of sensible noise, as that is what has impressed me most about \u201cNext Akin To Chaos\u201d. Stardust Speedclaw Even though \u201cStardust\u201d will never be my favourite album of all time, it is one that I will treasure and enjoy when I hear it passing me by. It just confirms to me that SPEEDCLAW have done good in choosing this as their musical direction. Eternal Return To Darkness What RETURN TO DARKNESS does is be themselves, to play the kind of music they like, without trying to emulate or copy their peers in any way or form. And what they have produced has been brought together on \u201cEternal\u201d. Bloody good stuff, if you ask me. Celestial Clear Moonlit Storming The information in the bio is indeed what you will find on the album. The hypnotic gaze of many of the songs does create a shimmering effect, but the production is so raw it takes away from my enjoyment. It does have peaks of intrigue, but four of the five songs also have a similar sound that is hard to distinguish. The Graves and Ghosts of Yore Deogen Overall, this was a solid album. Black Metal can really push the limits of aggressiveness and rage, but sometimes you need pauses to them, and the album does a nice job of balancing both. The Endchanter Araphel Overall, this was a solid listen for me. It wasn\u2019t necessarily anything new, or even out of the box, but the band presented some somber melodies along with a heaping of darkness and aggression, and that balance created an enjoyable listening experience. Seitsem\u00e4n soihdun valossa Victimarum Overall, this was an album that just burned from start to finish, and \u201cmelancholy misery\u201d is an apt word for the collection of songs. A little more diversity could have taken the album further, but I admire their commitment to their sound. Fire & Ice (single) Rozario \u201cFire & Ice\u201d is the first single/video from the highly anticipated new album from the hard rocking Norwegian band ROZARIO With Guts And Glory Centinex I have to say that after listening to \u201cWith Guts And Glory\u201d I was disappointed that there weren\u2019t any more songs on the album. I feel that with less than half an hour of new discoveries the audience could feel they deserved a few more tunes. Silicon Tea Evil Scarecrow Did you know that submarines can have feelings too? Well, if you listen to opener \u201cNuclear Fallout Machine Sentience\u201d the band will set you straight on that one Stronghold Human Fortress Musically there is no way around the way HUMAN FORTRESS plays their music. this is Epic, this is Power Metal, and these guys are very well-equipped to bend what they make into a shape that fits them down to a T. There isn\u2019t a song that doesn\u2019t fit, there is no note that has been put wrong, there are no mistakes or mishaps on \u201cStronghold\u201d. Severance Jet Jaguar While the songs are clearly the most important part of the process when they write their music, they also never forget to have fun while doing so. That makes that especially guitarist Ariyuki Saddler gets the chance to demonstrate his techniques. The Purest Ending Sainte Obyana Du Froid One of the best parts of the album, besides the themes matching the music very well, is that despite the length of the songs you don\u2019t notice them passing by for so long. Indeed, the album does a nice job of pulling in the listener into its cold, winter sound, and immersing you in its imagery. Although it\u2019s a barren and freezing landscape, it\u2019s also something that I now want to experience for myself. Where All of Worth Comes to Wither Malignant Aura The title of the album is very fitting to the songs. Besides a healthy amount of dissonance and aggression, the songs dive deep into the earth, seeking refuge in a cold, wet cave where no sunlight even dares to enter. Sila Nuna Sedna This is an album that is not about a specific genre\u2026it\u2019s about a world of possibilities. The experience is very personal, such that the listener can decide for themselves how it makes them feel. For me, it was a reminder of some of the mistakes I made in life, and in my innate ability to move past them. The darkness is there to serve you in whichever way you choose\u2026good or bad. Time Under Tension Karate Steve Boston Massachusetts melodic death metal/hardcore outfit,\u00a0Karate Steve,\u00a0dropped their third album\u00a0Time Under Tension\u00a0on October 24th, 2025. [\u2026] Skogskult Skogskult A lot of notable extreme metal, Doom and otherwise, comes out of Ume\u00e5. SKOGSKULT keeps up the tradition with their debut album. House of the Rising Smoke Goatfather A smoking pillar of fuzz-infused and psych-inspired tunage. Nuit Noire Arbre-Dieu Within the wide genre boundaries of Black Metal these days, there is most definitely a place for \u201cNuit Noire\u201d by ARBRE-DIEU. I didn\u2019t find the album as raw as advertised\u2026instead, I found intelligent songwriting, with carefully crafted passages to keep your sense ever stimulated, and a sense of the macabre. There was also an air of mystery to the album\u2026a feeling that there is more out there if you take the time to search. Insatiable Flagelo a LOT of noise, and a LOT of waiting for the noise to actually DO something. What Once Was Fimbul Winter \u201cWhat Once Was\u201d is dark, epic, and melancholic. It offers excellent guitar work, crushing basslines, and chilling melodies, all kept together very well by versatile vocals Taetra Philosophia Abysmal Grief Creepy at times, this is a Doom Metal album for old school fans of the genre. Although I don\u2019t know it, I get the feeling that the band has a cult following, because of how long they have been around, and their sound hasn\u2019t changed much. For me, it was just a mediocre listening experience that just didn\u2019t offer any surprises. Backbone Ronnie Romero Over the past decade Ronnie Romero has worked with the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen,Michael Schenker, [\u2026] Vertigo Shiraz Lane Hailing from Vantaa, Finland, Shiraz Lane started their musical journey in 2011. Their vision of [\u2026] Forgotten Reveries DarkTribe Clean vocals? Boo-hoo. This is METAL. Black Sites in Lower Chambers Wild Beyond Black Sites in Lower Chambers\u00a0is the newest EP from Philadelphia Pennsylvania black/death metal band\u00a0Wild Beyond.\u00a0This [\u2026] Ethereal Horizons Blut Aus Nord Maybe the album was hyped too much, because although it was excellent, it didn\u2019t deliver enough experimental or Progressive elements for me. They were there, but nearly always took a back seat to the ferocious and naked aggression on the album. It\u2019s clear that Vindsval is talented, and his vision is unwavering, but I would not have minded some more experimentation. Mar Da Deriva Vauruv\u00e3 If the album makes you look for answers, it did its job properly. But, there are no answers to be found. Instead, the deep-pocket sound deals with possibilities that almost seem endless, laying out a myriad of paths one could follow and allowing each person to make that decision for themselves. Midnight Blitz (single) Tailgunner When heavy metal icon K K Downing produces your latest album and loudly proclaims \u201cThey personify everything that is heavy metal\u201d the music world takes notice. Something Borrowed\u2026Something New Greystone Canyon The name of the album is quite fitting. \u201cSomething Borrowed\u2026Something New\u201d relates to the fact that half of the songs are covers and the other half new songs by the band themselves. GREYSTONE CANYON has released two albums before this one, and the 2024 one called \u201cIron & Oak\u201d got a perfect rating from my colleague \u201cMetal Mark\u201d Garcia. He rightfully wrote that these Aussie have a knack to sound like they belong in the seventies. And that they also really know how to play and make songs sound good. Embrace The Awakening Mezzrow \u201cEmbrace The Awakening\u201d has been produced at a very good and transparent level, which allows you to hear very instrument in detail. It also has been given enough punch to make sure that all the songs that MEZZROW has put on this album has the right amount of energy, excitement and power. Chama Soulfly Gone is the jumping up and down from the early years, only to be substituted by a much more Industrial Metal vibe, whilst keeping a little bit of Groove Metal vibe, but also a little bit of Thrash Metal atmosphere in there. It makes for interesting listening, as to me this sounds like Max Cavalera is trying to recreate the effect that NAILBOMB had some thirty years ago. You Are Safe From God Here The Acacia Strain \u201cYou Are Safe From God Here\u201d is over 38 minutes of panzer-like tank-worthy deafening and explosively deadly Deathcore. Because if one thing becomes clear, it is that the band have only gotten Heavier, a lot more menacing and almost lethal in their approach to how they write and play songs. There is only one way to go; to be as destructive and devastating as is humanly possible. DARK III Civil Service Without vocals to easily guide your way, you are going to have to dig in deeper and feel the music they present. Although much of the album reveled in tones of grey and even black at times, the closing message is a plea to break down as many barriers as possible on your way through this journey we call life. I haven\u2019t heard any album that moved me on an emotional level as this one did, nor one where the song titles were so perfectly matched with the music. [] Lutosfera This is the type of Black Metal album that was made for people who like their genre styles outside of the box. The experimental side of the album keeps a strong surprise factor that takes away the normal guide you might have as a listener and just burns it up. What is left is a maze of webs that you are thrust into head first without a light and you have to figure your way out, with a soundtrack of pain, torture, and madness blasting into the landscape. Epoch of Eternal Silence Nirrti The album danced with your sense of fear that was heightened by all of the dark magic on the album, and toyed with your sense of curiosity to the point that you no longer wanted to overturn rocks and find out what came next. Once it ensnared you, it would not let you escape, and it seemed like a lifetime of pain and torture was poured into seven songs. 1 2 3 \u2026 1033 1034 Next \u00bb More results...

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

Everyone has their favourite records of course; but FFAK\u2019s discography is one that I\u2019ve majorly only heard praise for and considering they\u2019re coming up on their 8th full-length album; that isn\u2019t something you find in a whole lot of bands. They have continuously tweaked and polished their sound without straying too far from their strengths and this remains the case for their upcoming LP Lonely God. The record contains everything their fans would want out of a FFAK project and more, finding the band not only in a stride but with the addition of some new flavours as well. 1 2 3 - 104 >> Please leave this field empty SUBSCRIBE We keep your data private and share your data only with third parties that make this service possible.

Grand Theft Auto V Nov 18, 2014 \u2022 Rated M The sprawling sun-soaked metropolis of Los Santos is chock full of self-help coaches, starlets and C-List celebrities, once on top of the media world, now struggling to stay relevant in time of economic malaise and lowest-common-denominator reality TV.

NFL 2K1 Sep 7, 2000 \u2022 Rated E In the end, NFL 2K1 is a deeper, more refined version of the original game. 97 Metascore 16.

[Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience.

Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels, explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them? [2K Games] 96 Metascore 18.

In the meantime, the Denver trio has released 2 LPs, a full-length EP, a split with Unearthly Trance , and a collab with Full of Hell . Those ten years were spent experimenting, learning, and honing their sound into something so incredibly bleak that not even the promo pit could contain such hopeless darkness.\u201d Man against earlier man. Sacred Leather \u2013 Keep the Fire Burning Review By Steel Druhm on December 11, 2025 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Speed Metal , 31 comments \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Indiana, so I\u2019m not acquainted with how they do things. After listening to Sacred Leather \u2019s sophomore outing, Keep the Fire Burning , I\u2019m definitely left wondering if time moves differently there, though. That\u2019s because this is one of the most retro, throwback-y pure metal things I\u2019ve heard in some time, with a sound so hopelessly locked between 1983-1986, that I feel my back hair receding as my olde denim jacket grows new new Venom and Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead patches. When I call this style \u201cdated,\u201d what I really mean is carbon-dated. Now, don\u2019t take this as a criticism, as those years were some of the very best for classic heavy metal.\u201d Firing the night. Record\u2019s o\u2019 the Month \u2013 October 2025 By Steel Druhm on December 10, 2025 in Record o' the Month , 156 comments The October Record(s) o\u2019 the Month arrive just in time to take to your office holiday party! It\u2019s a power move. Sigh \u2013 I Saw the World\u2019s End \u2013 Hangman\u2019s Hymn MMXXV [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Grymm on December 9, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , 55 comments \u201cBefore we start\u2026 yes. Yes, we received I Saw the World\u2019s End \u2013 Hangman\u2019s Hymn MMXXV on time back when it was released this past June. There was a debate behind the scenes whether a complete remake of Sigh \u2019s seventh full-length from 2007, Hangman\u2019s Hymn , justifies a full-length review. At the end of the day, newer, current bands and releases that were created in 2025 needed precedence, and thus a remake of a classic album, one that many feel didn\u2019t necessarily need one, took a backseat. In doing so, many people slept on it and decided to move on.\u201d The Sigh swings high. Nattradio \u2013 The Longest Night Review By Andy-War-Hall on December 9, 2025 in Reviews , Ambient , Doom Metal , Gothic Metal , 10 comments \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to take long for the \u201cwee hours\u201d of the night to kick in these winter days. With them comes a very specific, almost hypnotic sadness that anyone who sleep has forsaken knows well. That tag-team of coldness and isolation brought on by the night just can\u2019t be beat sometimes. Swedish goth/doom duo Nattradio know this sensation intimately, as their new album The Longest Night was written and shaped exclusively in the latest hours of the night. Injecting their Katatonia -inspired Gothic doom with elements of ambient music and noir jazz, Nattradio crafted their sophomore record to reflect the somberness of wakeful late nights, framing its ideal listening time in those hours.\u201d Music for a midnight dreary. Clouds \u2013 Desprins [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Thus Spoke on December 8, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Death Doom , Funeral Doom , 9 comments \u201cThose of you who have been paying close attention may remember that Clouds \u2019 2021 album Desp\u00c7\u008er\u00c8\u009bire was the subject of my very first review here at AMG; a review that in my n00bish na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9, I appended with a 4.5. I don\u2019t regret it, but will admit the name Clouds had faded a little in my mind before a sudden and apparently unannounced drop of Desprins back in January caused all the sweet sadness to come flooding back.\u201d Like waves of melancholy, Clouds drift in. Fleshvessel \u2013 Obstinacy: Sisyphean Dreams Unfolded Review By Spicie Forrest on December 8, 2025 in Reviews , Avant-Garde , Black Metal , Death Metal , Experimental Metal , Progressive Metal , 15 comments \u201cSisyphus is my favorite character in Greek mythology. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I picked up Obstinacy: Sisyphean Dreams Unfolded , the sophomore release from US-based metal vanguard, Fleshvessel . You see, not only does Sisyphus cheat Death twice\u00e2\u0080\u0094which in itself is hella metal\u00e2\u0080\u0094but in being damned to eternally roll a boulder uphill, he becomes an allegory for the human experience. This endless toil and glorification of the struggle serves as the thematic foundation for Obstinacy , revolving around \u00e2\u0080\u009cour own stubbornness/persistence as human beings and how it can be both a detriment to, or deliverance from, our collective and individual struggle for a better world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201d Rock and a slanted place. Atlantic \u2013 Timeworn [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By ClarkKent on December 7, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Atmospheric Black Metal , Black Metal , Post-Metal , 40 comments \u201cThe picture I have in my head of Ireland is an isolated, yet calming, place by the sea. Callan Hoy, from the western coastal town of Galway, further cements this image on the debut record of his atmospheric post-black project, Atlantic . It\u2019s apparent that the setting is important to Timeworn , as crashing waves not only begin and end the album, but they make frequent appearances throughout. This gives the feeling that Hoy recorded Timeworn right along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d Time, tides, trems. Gloombound \u2013 Dreaming Delusion [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Killjoy on December 6, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Death Doom , Funeral Doom , 34 comments \u201cFuneral doom metal is a subgenre that, when executed properly, is fertile ground for stimulating the listener\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagination. Perhaps this is because the glacial pace offers ample room for the mind to wander. Perhaps it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the music focuses more on deliberate mood than mindblowing technicality. With the right album artwork to gaze at, the experience is particularly immersive. While the music that Gloombound plays may be sonically closer to death-doom, it is composed with the same painstaking attention to detail as the best funeral doom.\u201d Doom with room to wander. Pillars of Cacophony \u2013 Paralipomena [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Owlswald on December 5, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Death Metal , Technical Death Metal , 25 comments \u201cAmidst the routine of our daily lives, it\u2019s easy to overlook the hidden, complex universe that exists just outside our normal gaze. It only takes a bit of magnification to reveal it: a place where cells shift and collide, forming the invisible architecture of existence. Capturing the awe of this biological machinery is a tall order. Yet, Dominik, multi-instrumentalist and mastermind of Pillars of Cacophony , has created a soundscape with second LP, Paralipomena , that does exactly that, exploring the building blocks of life through sound.\u201d Life and death metal find a way.

The Action Party The Action Party CD The ACTION PARTY is a tepid rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. Maybe you could say this is like a flaccid JONESES and stuff like that. I\u2019m betting their shows are a rocking good time, maybe. I\u2019m not sure this was quite the right place to send this for review. This is fine, well-produced rock\u2019n\u2019roll that might fit in better on a \u201cBest of the \u201890s\u201d college/alternative rock CD.I guess the one positive thing I can say is that I dozed off a couple times while listening to this, so if you are a little sleep-deprived, then this is the CD for you. Reviewer Tony Party Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Bahia de Kotxinos Bahia Kotxinos LP This is a strange piece of ephemera; a long-abandoned debut by Euskara band BAHIA DE KOTXINOS, who by all accounts were a leading light in an active scene and had a record ready to go that was left on the shelf, gathering Basque dust for the next 30 years. Now lovingly remastered and released into the world, it\u2019s a peculiar document of a very specific scene. It has the taut, frantic energy of yer DEVOs, yer WIREs, yer ADVERTS of the world. However, it also has the sort of wacky, clever-dick stylings of a kind of proto-egg-punk too, which is unfortunate. It\u2019s certainly a lot more interesting than I was anticipating, and well worth your time, albeit three whole decades later than you should have enjoyed it. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Discos Enfermos / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Bootcamp Time\u2019s Up LP Who doesn\u2019t like a great hardcore record that makes one punch a hole through a wall? Strap on your boots, because it\u2019s time to slam with Iowa City\u2019s BOOTCAMP. Proper USHC delivered in an intense manner, sounding fresh but remaining true to the classic tropes. You will find them on the same record store shelf as ARMOR and some of the 11 PM releases. Time\u2019s Up , go listen to this! Now! Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Convulse Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Dick Spikie Ultra Punk 4Cycle Vol. 1 EP Three fantastic Japanese Oi! tracks that will bring you to your feet to pogo with the best of them. Much like the BUSINESS and BLITZ, this trio of D-beat classics are equal parts catchy and rowdy as hell. \u201cRestriction & Freedom\u201d is the cream of this crop, an earworm that led me to spinning the A-side quite a few times. On the B-side, we have a song called \u201cYou\u2019re a Bastard\u201d that features some of my favorite lyrics of the year. Here\u2019s a taste: \u201cYou\u2019re a bastard / Wipe your arse yourself.\u201d Fair enough. For my money, Japanese Oi! has always sounded the most authentic, and this is no different. Grab this slab today! Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Private Scandal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Erosion Invasive Species LP The perceived amount of bands can often feel staggering in the internet age, and as much as you try to keep in tune with new releases, it feels like an impossible task that even a mythological hero would fail to complete. I normally feel comfortable among crust-related bands, so if even I have never heard of EROSION, I am not lost as far as what they are trying to achieve is concerned. In fact, besides MASSGRAVE, I have to admit that I don\u2019t know any of the bands the members of EROSION have been or currently are involved in. Who said the world was small? If EROSION includes a Swedish-flavoured dark metallic crust influence, I would not put them fully in the crust category. A lot is happening on their second LP Invasive Species , sometimes too much so for my basic brain, as this Vancouver act also incorporates elements of extreme metal (black or death) into their behemoth recipe that borders on blackened crust. The record is punishing, heavy, and mean, no doubt about it, and will appeal to metalheads and fans of modern crust alike. The label Mechanized Apparatus Revolt rightly compares them to MARTYRD\u00d6D, but they are more versatile and diverse. I would also add k\u00e4ng-driven metal bands like ADRESTIA adopting a blackened HIS HERO IS GONE approach (assuming that makes sense). It\u2019s a little too technical at times, and sometimes I have the impression that the band wants to do too many things in their songs. However, the sound is great and crushing, definitely an intense listen. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Mechanized Apparatus Revolt Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Frente Norte / The Old Breed split EP Broadly fine split between two Midwestern street punk-y types. My heart initially sank when I saw the cover and bore witness to not one but two fellas wearing the kind of daft flat cap only seen in Peaky Blinders , or on a Victorian chimney sweep or a fight at Cheltenham races, which is usually the sign of the worst kind plodding, midtempo, faux Oi! shite that makes me wish for an inner ear infection, but I was mostly pleasantly surprised. FRENTE NORTE, the stronger side of the split for sure, comes across like a janglier, more pop-oriented FUERZA BRUTA. OLD BREED\u2019s side is boring as fuck but not offensive; can always use that side of the split as a coaster or something. Reviewer Jason Harding Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Gnats Gnats demo cassette First demo from Florida-based, self-proclaimed bubblegum rock band. It\u2019s a little confusing reviewing a band\u2019s first release, which is a year-and-a-half old, when the band has dropped two releases since, but we happily write about what is assigned to us. Six tracks of lo-fi drum machine music with a keyboard seemingly set to emulate the sound of a swarm of bugs, hence the band\u2019s name. That\u2019s a funny idea and all, but not all ideas seem worth following through to fruition. This just comes off sounding like someone is badly playing a slide whistle over all of the songs, some of which actually seem well-crafted and have a fair amount of pop sensibility to them. The final song, \u201cSerial Mom,\u201d is really cool and driving right up until the point that the swarm of slide whistles comes in. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a stupid-sounding synth, but this reoccurring aspect through all six songs is just too commanding and makes the songs hopefully forgettable. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Rip Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Gruntwork Violence in the Workplace cassette Noise-addled, shit-fi punk that just might drive ya to the brink of homicidal rage if you\u2019re listening too close in proximity to your place of employment. Four snappy, over-before-you-know-it jammers that kick harder than your grandpappy\u2019s shotgun, this whole affair will take up less than five minutes of your precious time. For fans of HOAX, FRIED EGG, long stretches of unemployment, etc. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Human Future Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Ignorantes Las Promesas Que Te Hacemos Te Las Puedes Meter Por El Cul 7\u2033 Chilean punks IGNORANTES usually deal in scorched, blown-out, hyper-abrasive recordings\u2014the kind of raw tupa-tupa punk that is so harsh it feels like it\u2019s stripping paint. But this two-song 7\u2033 is a bit of a curveball, serving up super lo-fi but almost poppy Oi! with plasticky keyboards that give it an odd sweetness. While digging through their catalog for this review, the release that grabbed me most was No Hemos Inventado Nada, Ni Nos Interesa Hacerlo , even though the recording quality is so brutal it made my ears bleed. By contrast, this 7\u2033 is lighter and bouncier. Side A\u2019s \u201cAdi\u00f3s Camarada\u201d even carries a hint of that CURE \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d tune, which gives the whole thing an oddly familiar flavor. I respect the swing into new territory, even if it doesn\u2019t fully land for me. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label General Speech Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Kolpeka / Revert split 12\u2033 Perfectly executed split 12\u201d showcasing two bands from the Basque Country, a region whose punk and Oi! scene Mendeku Diskak has pretty much put on the map. On the A-side is REVERT, whose tooth-chipping stompers take cues from early Boston hardcore. REVERT\u2019s vocals are particularly rough and pissed, taking these songs up a notch or two on the aggro-meter. KOLPEKA follows up on the B-side, and while they retain some of the East Coast brutishness of their fellow countrymen, they have a little more spring in their step. I\u2019ve read from a couple of sources that KOLPEKA are avid skateboarders, so maybe that explains the slight uptick in energy. Regardless of its source, their speediness compliments the more mid-tempo pace of REVERT nicely, making for a well-rounded split. Top it all off with the killer artwork this is wrapped in, and Mendeku Diskak once again proves why they\u2019re one of the best in the game. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Liquid Cross Don\u2019t Think cassette In reading the Bandcamp description for this release, three things feel undeniable\u2014the SAINTS, the WIPERS, and the Pacific Northwest. I might add RADIO BIRDMAN here as well to round out what the listener might expect. These songs have a palpable desperation to them that really draws the listener in and along. The image of a fresh smelling pine tree enshrouded in a dense fog makes sense here as well; you can sense the presence of melody, but you can\u2019t easily see it through the wonderful sonic din. These tracks are timeless DIY. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Strange Mono Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Making Friends as Adults New Road CD I\u2019m never sure what\u2019s going to happen when an acoustic guitar starts off a record, but dang, it\u2019s in and out fast. Pulling from BRAID, DISCOUNT, LEMURA, POHGOH, FIFTH HOUR HERO, and so on, these are catchy songs delivered in a thoughtful, melodic way that can bring early ALKALINE TRIO to mind. Although MAKING FRIENDS AS ADULTS pulls from these bands, they also are clearly carving their own path. There are eleven songs on here and I think they maybe could have gone with eight or nine, but overall, this CD is a great listen. One bit of advice for MAKING FRIENDS AS ADULTS would be to not do it. I\u2019m in my fifties, and at a certain point, you know enough people and making friends is overrated and tiresome. Reviewer Tony Party Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Mask Appeal Slice & Slice EP Debut release from Los Angeles-based MASK APPEAL. With members from DETROIT COBRAS, OOZELLES, and the STARLITE DESPERATION to name a few, this lot is well steeped in a noisy, industrial death wail akin to the BIRTHDAY PARTY. The bass is way up front in the mix, propelling this creature forward, with big, hall-reverb drums, and both set the stage for a writhing, shimmering guitar and howling vocals that inspire a morbid fascination. A tragic poem recited to an anxious pulse. Thank you to whatever forces of good and evil brought these three together, MASKED APPEAL truly rules. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Slouch Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Okres Demo \u201985 / Jarocin \u201985 LP Pulled from obscurity and into your stack of questionable records, this archival LP remembers OKRES out of Ostr\u00f3w Wielkopolski, Greater Poland. The first half of the album features the band\u2019s demo recordings from 1985, and the second portion brings us another blast from the past of the legendary Jarocin music festival of that same year. It\u2019s fast and loose first wave hardcore driven by pure energy\u2014\u201cLiban Nie \u017byje\u201d has a wicked swarming guitar attack like Government Issue\u2019s \u201cSheer Terror.\u201d There\u2019s nine crude tunes from the demo and nine from the festival, but Bandcamp only teases four songs, so if you want to hear the whole thing, you\u2019ll have to pony up. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Warsaw Pact Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Pages Ordinary Love / I\u2019m a Bullet 7\u2033 From Portugal, these guys remind me of the TRANZMITORS, if only because they bring a sound rooted in mod and power pop. The music is straightforward and mid-tempo. The vocals are soft and almost whispery at times, just sort of calming. The B-side is particularly catchy and a total toe-tapper/head-bouncer. This is definitely worth checking out. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Lux Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Rude Television I Want to Believe EP Another entry in the egg-punk universe: bouncy synths, wiry guitars, playful neon energy. RUDE TELEVISION executes it well, though the formula feels reused, with the record\u00b4s explosive highlight being \u201cArtificial Paint.\u201d A fun, energetic listen\u2014enjoyable, but not essential. Otro cap\u00edtulo del universo egg-punk: sintes saltarines, guitarras procesadas y ese pulso juguet\u00f3n que define el estilo. RUDE TELEVISION lo hace bien, aunque la f\u00f3rmula se siente reutilizada, siendo el punto \u00e1lgido del disco su track \u201cArtificial Paint.\u201d Un disco simp\u00e1tico, energ\u00e9tico y disfrutable, aunque no esencial. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Sweet Time Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Spares / Treasure Pains split 12\u2033 Alright, I\u2019ve griped about this before, so I wanna get it out of the way first\u2014please stop halving split albums between two different Bandcamp accounts. It defeats the purpose of said split! I know it\u2019s all together on the record, but the vast majority of people will be listening online. Keep it together, folks! SPARES play classic post-hardcore and remind me a bit of RUSSIAN CIRCLES (with vocals), and THRICE. TREASURE PAINS are in the same realm and have more of a dissonant edge like RIVAL SCHOOLS and HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. Production for both bands is crisp and loud as hell. Really solid stuff here. I\u2019d go as far as saying it\u2019s worth bouncing between two Bandcamps. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Council / Wiretap Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Speed Week Weak Speed 12\u2033 With players from the excellent Australian bands the BRAKES and SPLIT SYSTEM comes a snarling slab of punk with conviction. SPEED WEEK presents here with an assured confidence and maturity that perfectly tempers their wild-eyed energy. Reminiscent of more mainstream acts like SHAME or FONTAINES D.C. but with a wiry cool, this band sounds poised for bigger and better things without the fear of losing their edge. It\u2019s well-read, high-energy punk rock that doesn\u2019t miss a step. Impressive as so few new acts are. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Erste Theke Tontr\u00e4ger Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Subversive Intent Subversive Intent demo cassette A solid debut from San Diego\u2019s newest hardcore outfit SUBVERSIVE INTENT. Plenty of speed and leads on top of leads call to mind SoCal legends BATTALION OF SAINTS. Better than average production pushes this one past usual demo fare, making it more than worth a listen. Check out \u201cPayaso\u201d and \u201cWeathervane.\u201d Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Camel Clutch / Rebirth Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Sympathy Flowers Dreams of Lurking Fear LP Dreams of Lurking Fear is the first full-length by Oakland, CA dark punk band SYMPATHY FLOWERS. However, Dreams of Lurking Fear is an expansion of last year\u2019s Through the Veil cassette (which was SYMPATHY FLOWERS inaugural release), with most of the cassette tracks being reworked with a better density and richness for the LP. There\u2019s something in SYMPATHY FLOWERS\u2019 sound that reminds me of the below-the-radar punk that cemented my relationship to our illustrious genre in my teen years. Maybe it\u2019s the driving rhythms blended with the quick shift guitar riffs, or maybe it\u2019s the poetic-but-direct lyrics that are defiant while deviant. Whatever it is, Dreams of Lurking Fear scratches an itch I didn\u2019t even know I had. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Cellofame Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 TTTTurbo Modern Music cassette Someday people who write great pop songs won\u2019t be so scared of themselves, obscuring their catchiness with lo-fi tricks and budget ethos. But in the meantime, it\u2019s still lovely to spend time with a tape like this that sounds like California underwater with the good vibes still intact. The bouncy bass lines walking up and down the throbbing synths and half-muttered bedroom vocals can\u2019t hide forever that these are bangin\u2019 pop songs. I hear you, TTTTURBO, and I know what you\u2019re up to. You can throw an egg on top while you\u2019re at it. Sounds great like an artifact from the future. Reviewer Luke Henley Label It's Eleven Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Uzu \u00c0 Qui La Libert\u00e9? \u0644\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u061f LP Symphony of Destruction has quite the knack for bringing us bands that push the boundaries of punk. Case in point: UZU returns with their second full-length, building out their deathrock gloom ship for further exploration. Based in Montr\u00e9al, the group is an international outfit with ties to Algeria and Colombia, delivering their lyrics in Arabic. To the latter point, the vocal delivery is one of the elements that sets UZU apart, with an inflection falling somewhere between Jello Biafra and Rozz Williams. While CHRISTIAN DEATH is certainly a jumping-off point, UZU charts a path of their own, much like fellow Canucks HOME FRONT and ULTRA RAZZIA (with whom they share members) have. Inspiration is more a point of departure than an anchor. \u00c0 Qui La Libert\u00e9? is a bold, forceful album. Don\u2019t sleep on this one. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Symphony of Destruction Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Why Bother? Case Studies LP Prolific punks WHY BOTHER? are back with another LP on the heels of an EP released earlier this year. While the former relied heavily on a synthesized version of \u201980s-inspired Midwestern punk, Case Studies sees the band, yet again, charting fresh ground, but I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s such a good thing. Make no mistake, every few songs, there is a song that rips. They shine on tracks like \u201cI Take Back,\u201d \u201cThere She Was,\u201d or the album closer \u201cGalaxy Eyes,\u201d where they effortlessly combine heavy \u201970s psych melodies with SPITS-style lo-fi goodness, and vocals that call to mind early GUIDED BY VOICES. Unfortunately, the rest of the record felt boring and longwinded. Songs often drift in and out of ambient and instrumental explorations that would best be saved for a Friday jam session rather than on a recording. Repeated listens could change my mind, but I\u2019m not sure I have the attention span to reach for this one again. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Feel It Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Xray Xeroxx Social Media Made Me Hate My Friends cassette Short and sweet four-song cassette EP by an incredibly active Los Angeles-based solo project. This is the third cassette release by XRAY XEROXX (two EPs and a full-length), all of which came out this damn year! Juvenile, upbeat, poppy, garage-infused RAMONES-core filled with both self-deprecation and societal deprecation. There sure is a lot to hate in this world, but I do not hate XRAY XEROXX. Looking forward to the three releases this project is due to shit out throughout 2026. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Robot Cannibal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 1-800-Mikey / Gee Tee split EP Split release pairing Sydney\u2019s 1-800 MIKEY and GEE TEE. 1-800 MIKEY is a project from Michael Barker, who also plays in GEE TEE. His tracks are lo-fi, innocent, and achingly whimsical, similar to fellow Sydneysiders TEE VEE REPAIRMANN and Portland\u2019s CHEERY CHEEKS. GEE TEE has been referred to as the Australian SPITS, but on their track, they slow it down with a tune that sounds beautifully crafted like NOBUNNY covering DANIEL JOHNSTON in a bedroom on a four-track. Reviewer Tim Janchar Label Prison Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Alibi Alibi cassette Yet another contemporary German throwback to the Neue Deutsche Welle, and I\u2019m not mad about it. Opener \u201cIrgendwas Ist Immer\u201d builds plenty of tension and drama over three-and-a-half minutes, and there\u2019s a sharp, Zickzack\u2019d angularity cutting through in the staccato guitar stabs and rigid rhythms of \u201cAttit\u00fcde\u201d and \u201cZust\u00e4nde,\u201d but on a whole, Kiel\u2019s ALIBI are far less shrouded and goth-influenced than the Berlin-based contingent of modern XMAL DEUTSCHLAND disciples like AUS, DIE SCHIEFE BAHN, and MISERE, landing somewhere closer to the second HANS-A-PLAST LP that bridged their late \u201970s speedy punk spark with an expanded early \u201980s post-punk palette. Impressively tight and locked-in for what\u2019s essentially a first demo, and if whatever comes next plays up even more of the latent art-damage that I\u2019m picking up on here, it could be genuinely savage. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Flennen Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Baby Tyler Sucker With a Dream LP BABY TYLER is back and better than ever. I\u2019ll admit it, on the first listen I wasn\u2019t impressed. It was exactly what I expected, hardcore-tinged garage punk rippers. Nothing more, nothing less. The first two tracks didn\u2019t do much for me at first, but the third track caught my attention with the lyric \u201cAnd if you give it nothing / What do you expect in return?\u201d This stuck out to me, and days later it was still in my head. Tracks six through eight expand on the sound of the first few songs and have some of my favorite moments on the LP. The horn breakdown on \u201cRinse Repeat\u201d is a great example, as is the menacing vocal on \u201cGood Motivator.\u201d The bass and drums really stand out and work together seamlessly to move the songs forward, while the guitar takes a back seat and adds subtle flavor where needed. Elsewhere, the bass can be overpowering at times, and I wish the guitars hit a little harder. Lyrically, vocalist Tyler Fassnacht angrily questions his dedication to the craft, the idea of \u201csuccess,\u201d and what it means to a mid-thirties DIY punk who has spent most of his life on tour and making records. \u201cIf you give it nothing, what can you expect in return?\u201d The answer is nothing. Fucking nothing. But if you give it everything, time and time again, you may end with an LP full of piss and vinegar, yet still poppy enough to leave hooks in your head for days. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Night Bell Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Crist\u00f8 Fragments of the Inferno cassette Dark, evil-sounding hardcore punk from Los Angeles, CA. CRIST\u00d8 follows up their first digital release from two-and-a-half years ago with a ripping seven-song cassette. It might not be heard by everyone, but the songwriting and vocal patterns sound to me like the band wisely took a page or two out of the NUCLEAR ASSAULT playbook. This recording really shines when leaning into the speed-metal-inspired aspects of their sound. With the cassette release only limited to a mere fifteen copies, good luck getting your hands on one. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 D.U.N.C.E. Demo 1 EP Coming out of the gates sounding like a menacing version of PRISON AFFAIR and then settling in with their own thing entirely, D.U.N.C.E. does a killer job of introducing themselves to the masses with this demonstration. There is a sheen of effortlessness that coats this offering, especially on the highlight \u201cShark,\u201d that is not too unlike the energy of a SPIRITUAL CRAMP or a HANK WOOD AND THE HAMMERHEADS. Demos should seek to turn a head or grab an ear, and D.U.N.C.E. successfully stops the listener in their tracks and makes them whip their head. Excited for what\u2019s to come, but glad for what we\u2019ve got. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Human Future / No Human Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Emma Goldman Sachs Everything Up Until Now cassette Get ready for some scratchy, growly vocals. These guys were playful, diving into some more Western sounds or kind of groovy punk. The vocals stand out to me the most, as they really take the song into different places. Super fun band. Reviewer Emma Miller Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Eskorbuto Anti Todo LP reissue Reissue of a classic Euskara band\u2019s classic record. In many ways, it\u2019s pretty churlish of me to try and add to the big pile of discourse around this band and release. What more is there to say that hasn\u2019t already been said? A pivotal band in the development of punk en Espanyol , and this is them in the midst of a clear purple patch. A step change from the \u201977-inspired early material into arms-aloft, \u201cwhoa\u201d-infused choruses for the ages. \u201cEs Un Crimen\u201d is surely in the pantheon of the greats by now. Unsure if we really need to add any more onto the big critical landfill surrounding this record, or indeed what the point is in remastering punk records in general, but if it encourages you to give this a listen, then do it. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Munster Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Flying Heads Flying Heads LP Tell any punk who grew up in Chicagoland that FLYING HEADS feature members from TV SLIME, and they\u2019re going to jump at it immediately. Incredible noise/crust punk that brings to mind some of the best to do it, like ELECTRO HIPPIES and DOOM. There\u2019s also a sludge element much like MELVINS and KILSLUG. This is one of those records where you have no other choice but to listen to it loud as hell\u2014it imposes that upon itself. If you\u2019re not blasting this into your eardrums, then you ain\u2019t living, friend. Chicago is known for an array of different punk-adjacent genres, but this sloppy, raucous rock\u2019n\u2019roll feels most at home to me. This pairs perfectly with an Old Style and a shot of Malort. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 G.A.Z.E. G.A.Z.E. 12\u2033 Ever wondered how PAINTBOX would sound if they were Finnish? Helsinki\u2019s Burning Spirits-influenced hardcore heroes are back with more vicious melodies. Many have tried and many have failed to emulate the sound that the Japanese NWOBHM-influenced punks crafted so well. G.A.Z.E. is an exception to that rule. They nail the style so well because they strive to retain the high-energy, uplifting mood that characterized the classics like DEATH SIDE or JUDGEMENT. It\u2019s supposed to be a constant yin/yang of brutality and melody, but always very bright. The guitar leads are performed to perfection, the vocal delivery is complete with the classic gang shouting, and the songs are very unpredictable, thanks to a great usage of tempo shifts. There is even time for out-of-the-box instruments to make an appearance, like saxophone, violin, and double bass. They have studied their lesson well. Essential listening. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label D-Takt & R\u00e5punk Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 H.A.L.T. II 12\u2033 H.\u00c4.L.T. out of Vancouver, BC recently released their second full-length 12\u2033, affectionately entitled II . Their latest release brings more bop, more punk, and more goth to their already gloom-infested sound. The eight-song II is sonically dense with its shifting, danceable rhythms, intriguing organ/synth work, and gnarly guitar tones. Personally, the second song \u201cForever Dead\u201d is my favorite with its defiant perspective, and I love how that song transitions into the spectral \u201cVoices.\u201d In all, this is a fantastic work of dark delights. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Jodie Faster Saint Lundi LP Nineteen songs of feverish hardcore punk from France. No distortion, no breakdowns, no songs over 1:45, and no time to slow down! Super-political, super-fast, and the origin of Saint Lundi has me wanting to quit my job and go slam a pint! JODIE FASTER has been dishing out \u201cshort songs played fast\u201d for a decade, and it truly shows on Saint Lundi . My favorite moment on the record is when vocalist screams \u201cfuck that!\u201d during a split-second pause in \u201cS.O.R.G.A.\u201d This shit rules. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Don't Trust the Hype / Drinkin' Beer in Bandana / La Agon\u00eda De Vivir / Loner Cult / No Time / Pasidaryk Pats / Spastic Fantastic / TNS Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ryan Kidd Rock n Rule LP RYAN KIDD is rock\u2019n\u2019roll punk with sass and swagger, pulling in elements of DEAD BOYS and the SAINTS. This comes in punchy and will hook you with catchy choruses, but you\u2019ll stay for the oddball guitar work that punctuates the verses from time to time. I\u2019d be remiss to not include that some of these tunes reflect EXPLODING HEARTS and Dirtnap Records with their melody and power pop hooks. There is yelling on this Rock N Rude LP, some \u201cwoo-woo\u201ds, \u201cyaaaohh\u201ds, snotty Stiv Bators vocal stuff, and most of the songs are perfectly lyrically vague enough that you could get away with singing them around town without getting side-eyed. This record is for you if you like beer, bars, and places that have punk shows that have been around so long that smoking cigs inside has been grandfathered into the building\u2019s lease. Reviewer Tony Party Label Human B-Side Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Last Survivors / Vaxine split EP The zipper on the front of this record should be a hint of what you\u2019re in for. The release notes promise a love letter to the UK82 scene \u201corganically mixed with the sound of raw \u201980s global hardcore,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what it delivers. VAXINE (NYC) tears through three politically-charged two-minute blasts that land somewhere between DISCHARGE and CHAOS UK, with a whiff of MOT\u00d6RHEAD swagger in the intro to \u201cWar Criminals.\u201d LAST SURVIVORS (Tokyo) follow with two tracks that sound rougher, like a third-generation tape dub, but they still bring four minutes of pure basement energy. Both bands hit that sweet spot of raw, mid-range-heavy \u201980s-style punk without too much of the metallic drift some of their influences leaned into. Every song could\u2019ve been trimmed by half a minute, but it\u2019s still a strong dose of unfiltered, boots-on-the-floor hardcore. For fans of the punkiest of punk sounds, this one\u2019s worth tracking down. The high point for me was VAXINE\u2019s \u201cThread of Hate.\u201d Reviewer Jeff Cost Label General Speech Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Makin\u2019 Out Living in a Glass House LP I love this sort of thing\u2014kind of soft, kind of jangly female-fronted pop music. That said, it always has to be done well. She\u2019ll probably hate the reference, but the singer has great range and can hit highs that remind of Dolores O\u2019Riordan of the CRANBERRIES. But this one does have its moments of grittiness, with the pretty vocals occasionally drifting into distress. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Dead Broke Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 No Sector / Peracetic split EP Representing New Zealand and Nova Scotia respectively, NO SECTOR and PERACETIC prove that hardcore is still spoken fluently across the globe on this ripping split. NO SECTOR is deliciously dialed-in across their three tracks, serving up a satisfying splash of intensity in just four minutes. It\u2019s hard to pick a favorite from this addictive little set, but if I had to, it\u2019s \u201cBootcamp.\u201d Thrashier and less compressed, PERACETIC manages to shoot out six tunes in roughly the same amount of time, each one surrounding the listener like a tornado of razors. Glorious. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Sewercide Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Prise Rapide Trop Plein cassette Goddang, you ever just hear a band that means what they say and plays it well? Admit it, it happens fewer times than you think. Well, let\u2019s take a look at PRISE RAPIDE from Paris (not Texas). This music feels like it wears its heart on its sleeve, and drives it home like a stake through a vampire\u2019s heart. The hooks and melodic turns here will keep you locked in throughout its relatively short runtime (just under 30 minutes). The bass is honey bright with presence, anchoring otherwise zig-zagging melodic post-punk without ever getting too dour. It\u2019s good stuff, I don\u2019t know what else to tell ya. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Dirty Slap / Jour du Pluie / Yoyodyne Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Split System No Cops in Heaven / Pull the Trigger 7\u2033 Aussie five-piece SPLIT SYSTEM has released their third 7\u2033 of 2025, and the A-side \u201cNo Cops in Heaven\u201d is killer \u201970s-style punk with clenched-jaw propulsion. It\u2019s mid-tempo, but the rhythm section plays like they\u2019re sprinting forward at full tilt, locked into a locomotive groove that gives the song that RADIO BIRDMAN-esque push where everyone else has to keep up or get steamrolled. Guitars leave zero breathing room, and the whole thing has that piston engine momentum that made me want to play it again the second it ended. \u201cPull the Trigger\u201d doesn\u2019t hit quite as hard, but it\u2019s still a solid shot at war profiteers. The more I hear from this band, the more I dig \u2019em. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Legless / Static Shock Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Stabber Shut Up EP Sick debut from this Norwegian outfit. A potent compound of two parts USHC and one part rock\u2019n\u2019roll. A couple of the licks reminded me of early ANNIHILATION TIME. A couple more made me think of CAREER SUICIDE. Clear production works to their favor, especially when the tempo downshifts and the bassist tramps up and down the fretboard. \u201cRepeat Offender\u201d feels like the completed distillation of what they\u2019re, uh, stabbing at, but this is a tight EP from start to finish. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Kick Rock / Stab! Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Subhumans Demolition Wars Demos 2xLP Sealed Records unapologetically does it again, this time with an epic double album including SUBHUMANS\u2019 three early demos recorded before the release of their iconic first EP Religious Wars . This massive undertaking is actually a reissue as Bluurg Records had released these three recordings on a tape entitled Demolition War Parts I-III in 1981, so it\u2019s pretty unlikely anyone already has a physical copy these days anyway (beside that hammered old punk at the pub who rather embarrassingly claims that \u201cpunks were punks back in the days\u201d\u2014you know the sort, avoid at all costs). As \u201980s demos recorded cheaply at Warminster\u2019s local youth center and The Old Bell, the production is raw, but the band was already so skillful, tight, catchy, and proper energetic that it confers a new charm to otherwise well-known anthemic songs from their early period, and the record brings some further context to the band\u2019s first steps with some interviews and collages. As a bonus, it even has three unreleased numbers in case you needed additional arguments. If you have never heard SUBHUMANS, I envy you, because you are about to discover a wonderful slice of snotty UK punk. This might not be the greatest point of entry into the catalog of one of the most respected and most consistent anarcho-punk bands still playing and delivering (which is more than can be said about legions of \u201creformed punk legends\u201d), and 60 minutes of raw versions of (even undeniably great) old school punk songs could be a bit hard to take for a newcomer. However, it is obviously a mandatory purchase for anarcho lovers. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Sealed Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Traumatizer Nuclear War Machine EP Since their self-titled debut from last year, I\u2019ve been a big fan of TRAUMATIZER\u2019s brutal brand of D-beat, and on their new EP Nuclear War Machine , they sound gnarlier than ever. Each of the five tracks here showcases their ability to seamlessly meld their influences into a streamlined sound that is entirely their own. Excellent riffs, excellent drumming, and excellent vocals, what more could you ask for? For fans of ANTI-CIMEX, SACRILEGE, and MOT\u00d6RHEAD, this one\u2019s a no-brainer. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Discos Enfermos Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Vor\u00e1gine P\u00e1nico EP VOR\u00c1GINE is Peruvian D-beat, punk crudo at its best. Primitivo in presentation and production, the P\u00e1nico EP will absolutely get your fist pumping. Seven tracks that contain bursts of Mot\u00f6r-punk forming bridges between noise-blasted lyrical delivery and everything happening at terminal velocity. If you\u2019re lacking in recent D-beat face-meltings, then you should probably check out VOR\u00c1GINE. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Discos Asalto / Little Jan's Hammer / Metadona / Tvmbalavalla Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Wavers Look What I Found LP The cyclical nature of music continues to resound as young folks renew and revise the spirit of \u201990s indie, centering bright hooks and big guitars. WAVERS, from Olympia where American indie has always thrived, sound familiar and novel at once, striking the perfect balance between the current crop of loftspace DIY rock and giants that came before\u2014even rhyming with early PAVEMENT in some of their guitar work. Vocalist/guitarist Rosie\u2019s soaring voice is smartly featured up front and center, bolstered by a smart and well-weathered backing band that knows what they like and how to play it. Drummer Charlie also sings sumptuous harmonies that will mist your eyes more than once, guaranteed. Totally gorgeous and self-assured emo-tinged indie that will ring true regardless what era it\u2019s heard in. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Reach Around / Salinas Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Xray Xeroxx Nevermind, Whatever cassette The forgotten Ramone was surely Eggy Ramone, no? XRAY XEROXX embodies the spirit of this made-up Ramone by giving us fourteen tracks of egged-up, RAMONES-meets-DEVO sugar rushes. While RAMONES and DEVO certainly get called to mind almost immediately, as the album goes on, those comparisons start to (d)evolve into something more like the QUEERS and the AQUABATS\u2014the immaturity of the lyrics, the performance/persona behind the music. These songs are definitely fun and snotty, but it does have me wondering if today\u2019s mainstream high schooler views this type of egg-punk in the same way a normie twenty years ago viewed REEL BIG FISH or the MAD CADDIES? Are lots of synth punks today just former marching band kids? Does SNOOPER sing along to MEPHISKAPHELES? Did PRISON AFFAIR perform in their high school musicals? Reviewer D. Gregory Label Robot Cannibal Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Aggravate Black Glass cassette Solid first offering from San Diego\u2019s AGGRAVATE. The band has one foot firmly planted in traditional USHC thanks to the straightforward vocals, but otherwise the proceedings are more atmospheric and heavier than your usual fare, almost approaching stadium crust. Overall not bad; I\u2019ll be curious to see what direction they go from here. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Human Future Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Bacarrudas Bleed Out, Get Pushed Off a Cliff, Sink to the Bottom of a Lake, and Play a Halloween Monster House Party! LP The title says it all, folks. A double LP full of campy, over-the-top, \u201960s-inspired monster madness straight out of Philadelphia. It\u2019s worthy of a seasonal spin during your next Pagan house party or seasonal sockhop. Songs like \u201cDracula\u2019s Castle\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s in Love with Frankenstein\u2019s Monster\u201d are loaded with all the reverb and tremolo of your fave \u201960s and \u201970s novelty records, and much to my enjoyment, they lean into the humor and campiness. It reminds me of the kind of stuff I would find in a used dollar bin and would scoop up without hesitation. It\u2019s pressed at 45 RPM on 12\u201d which adds to the novelty vibe. Overall, it\u2019s a fun record without a ton of memorable moments, but deserving of a listen if you\u2019re into the schtick. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Moms Basement / Schuylkill Beat Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Cold Summer Den Umst\u00e4nden Entsprechend 12\u2033 Good mix of post-punk and more classic punk rock\u2014their ability to go from the classically post-punk guitar in verses into a distorted explosion in the choruses was awesome. I really appreciated the noise and intensity that they kept up throughout, definitely a solid record.

This is the second LP this year for Sharp Pins following this spring\u2019s Radio DDR , and Slater was also a big part of Lifeguards\u2019 post-punk Ripped and Torn, as well.Never mind.

In six tracks which blend seamlessly into one musical entity, this pivotal collaboration from Brian Eno and Jon Hassell explores a mystical, minimalist music, tinted by Southern Hemisphere sounds but also incorporating 20th century electronics.

The album evokes a liminal metropolis bathed in the amber glow of sodium-vapor street lamps, where lonely souls wander down moonlit alleyways in search of something that has already left them long ago. It is here, where traffic lights blink for no one and smoke curls around sewer lids, that Hats stakes its home.

From Gregorian chants to swing bands, you never knew what would make it onto the radio. But some of the strangest groups to improbably infiltrate the mainstream came from the post-Grateful Dead jam band scene. Our guest today is Mike Ayers, author of \u2060 Sharing in the Groove: The Untold Story of the \u201990s Jam Band Explosion and the Scene that Followed. Aquarium Drunkard :: Year In Review 2025 Posted on December 8, 2025 December 11, 2025 Looking back to look ahead. The clock never stops, but sometimes music manages the impossible: slowing time for a moment. Our list arrives in the spirit of sharing, and we\u2019re back with our annual Year In Review. As always the following is unranked and unruly. Let it blurb. World Standard :: Human Circle of Memory Posted on December 5, 2025 December 4, 2025 While this year marked the fortieth anniversary of the avant-pop debut World Standard, musician Soichiro Suzuki returns with a brand new record Komorevia under the long-running moniker. Lead single \u201cHuman Circle of Memory\u201d is a carefully crafted work invoking the spirit of the last four decades of the singular World Standard universe, with fading reverberations and echoes of chiming bells and woodwinds overlapping with layered synthesizers (and soft vocals from Yoriko Matsumoto). A self-described sunlight filtering through the trees, indeed. Milton Nascimento :: Maria Maria (1976) Posted on December 4, 2025 December 3, 2025 While Milton Nascimento is more known internationally for his role in Brazilian jazz fusion, he also composed landmark MPB records of his own, that often brought forth folkloric Brazilians genres like toada , lundu , moda de viola , and even some Medieval revivalism. Maria Maria is a highlight among those explosions of ancestral rhythms. Composed as the soundtrack to a 1976 ballet about a black female slave choreographed by Group Corpo, it would eventually culminate in the historic Missa dos Quilombos in 1982, when Milton led a drum-filled Catholic mass for a legion of Afro-Brazilians in the Pra\u00e7a do Carmo, Recife . . .

But in the story Yo La Tengo, Electr-O-Pura doesn\u2019t invite lofty historicizing. Sandwiched between two of their most important records, it feels like business as usual\u2014and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so good. 30 years on, we can see how we were lucky enough to be invited inside their little world of inside jokes and off-kilter psychedelic jamming. Transmissions :: Steve Wynn (The Dream Syndicate) Posted on December 3, 2025 December 3, 2025 This week on the show, a return guest: Steve Wynn of The Dream Syndicate and solo fame. He last joined the show part of a trio: in 2018, we taped with him, Howe Gelb of Giant Sand, and Robyn Hitchcock live at the KXCI studio at Hotel Congress in Tucson Arizona. That talk also made it into the Transmissions feed again in 2021. Flea :: A Plea Posted on December 2, 2025 December 1, 2025 \u201cI\u2019m not being corny/this shit\u2019s for real,\u201d Flea intones over a bubbling jazz fusion groove on \u201cA Plea,\u201d a new solo single which finds the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist returning to his first instrument: the trumpet. Backed by a cadre of the West Coast\u2019s most innovative and hip jazz players, this a musical rebirth for the Funky Monk. Wednesday Knudsen :: Atrium Posted on December 2, 2025 November 29, 2025 An immersive double LP of woodsy ambient from upstate New York. You may recognize Wednesday Knudsen\u2019s name from her various collaborative projects \u2014 Pigeons, Stella Kola, Weeping Bong Band, a killer duo LP with Willy Lane, and probably many more. But Atrium is a true solo project, with Knudsen layering sax, synth, guitar, flute and autoharp to create a rich and spacious landscape worthy of such masters as Joanna Brouk, Laraaji and Iasos, alongside the Japanese environmental music tradition. Totem Pocket :: Chump Posted on December 2, 2025 November 30, 2025 The latest offering from Denver\u2019s Totem Pocket begins with its wooziest, weirdest song, a bad trip translated into thick, sludgy sound. Stick with it though! You\u2019ll be rewarded with a truly awesome slab of fuzzy and fierce dream pop. One crucial ingredient in the band\u2019s very tasty recipe is pure volume \u2014 an element that many worshipers at the altar of shoegaze somehow forget about. Bandcamping :: Winter 2025 Posted on December 1, 2025 November 30, 2025 Hark, the snow is falling! At least in some places of the world it is. As winter descends, we\u2019ve got some recent/recommended records to soundtrack the chillier months. Fill up your cart for the latest Bandcamp Friday on Dec. 5.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
