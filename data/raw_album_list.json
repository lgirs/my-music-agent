A love letter to the Lone Star State, from the title track to the drinking song to the closer with the armadillo.

Across decades of records, he\u2019s built a reputation on candor, dry humor, and a songwriter\u2019s instinct for finding grace in the wreckage of ordinary life.

    "page_text": "Reviews  - Metal Temple Magazine Menu Reviews Interviews Reports News Filters Order by Order by Order by Newest Oldest Best (10 - 1) None Search Search Search Rating Range Rating Range Reset Date Range Date Range Date Range Clear Reset All Reviews Reborn Through Torture Calcraft This was an excellent album, and it veered off of the path of the genre just enough to keep it intriguing. They used harrowing backing elements, some clean vocals and spoken words, and other techniques and by the end, I did feel like it was a soundtrack to the final scene of a movie that I would never survive. War Chariots White Baroness Overall, this wasn\u2019t a bad album by any stretch, it just didn\u2019t offer anything new to the genre. Purists might like this album because it stays within the traditions of the genre, but I like to hear bands taking more chances and experimenting more with their music. We Are Him Darvaza The album seemed to improve the longer I listened to it and with each forthcoming song. I also appreciated the religious themes within the music. Indeed, Black Metal was founded on religion\u2026anti-religion of course. This was a solid effort from the duo. Joker In The Pack Hell In The Club After signing to Frontiers Records in 2017, Hell in the Club released \u201cHell Of Fame\u201d [\u2026] Reactance Theory D'Ercole Listening to \u201cReactance Theory\u201d is also making me a very happy Rocker because the songs all have that little bit of class that you expect from a band that has been going for some 15 years, making it even more remarkable that they have been able to produce 11 albums, including this one. Time Skull & Crossbones Opening tune \u201cEchoes of Eternity\u201d goes from 0 to 100 mph in just a few seconds. And let me tell you, if this song doesn\u2019t do it for you, just ignore the rest of the album. Cybergenesis HyperioN HYPERION isn\u2019t the next band to take over the world, but they are a band that has the ability to please and entertain a lot of (mostly) old fashioned Metal fans with the music they have provided us with on \u201cCybergenesis\u201d. And because they have been able to provide the record with a very clear, transparent, but above all contemporary sound, a lot of the young Metal afficionados might be quite willing to not only give this a go, but also their sign of approval. Setting Fire To The Sky Urne On \u201cSetting Fire To The Sky\u201d URNE demonstrates that they are able to show different sides of themselves, whilst the sound and foundation available will convince you that you still are listening to the same band. What makes this an even listening experience is that all the songs bring a lot of quality to the turntable, making it very easy to like and/or admire this album. Counting Seasons Above Us The Waves I like the sound that ABOVE US THE WAVES better than I do the tunes individually. I would even go so far as to say that if they were able to write outstanding sounds, they would be able to make a real go at musical stardom.  Nevertheless, \u201cCounting Seasons\u201d is a very decent EP. Alt Som Finnes Bizarrekult The album has a quality to it as if it was trying desperately to offer some hope, but with each turn, they sunk the dagger deeper into your heart. Either way you slice it, the level of emotional impact is high\u2026almost devastating at times. You can feel each note in your stomach, like a rock that just keeps growing and there is no escape from the pain. Dark Side of the Soul The Mist The newest album by Brazilian thrash metal band\u00a0The Mist\u00a0entitled\u00a0The Dark Side of the Soul\u00a0is a [\u2026] Sorrow Feeds the Silence Mourn the Light Connecticut heavy metal band\u00a0Mourn The Light\u00a0has delivered a powerful new record entitled\u00a0Sorrow Feeds the Silence.\u00a0At [\u2026] Der schwarzen Flamme Verm\u00e4chtnis Ernte ERNTE gives us an altar full of second-wave Black Metal with \u201cDer schwarzen Flamme Verm\u00e4chtnis,\u201d reminding us that the old traditions are sometimes the best, especially the dark ones. Dreadful Waters Coronatus \u201cDreadful Waters\u201d is as fresh and bracing as the depths it explores. Lords of Hypocrisy (Reissue) Pagan Altar PAGAN ALTAR might not have conquered the world with this album, I do believe that, judging by what I am hearing on \u201cLords of Hypocrisy\u201d, they did and do deserve a whole lot more credit than they have had throughout their career. And in that respect, you have to applaud Dying Victims Productions for pushing the boat out by airing this album for a second time. Cheap Food Teutonic Slaughter TEUTONIC SLAUGHTER is able to translate their thoughts into bloody impressive songs that have that bit of an edge to them, you just can\u2019t help but enjoy all 36 minutes that they are making a lot of noise. The Glare Spriggan Mist According to the information sheet that comes with the music SPRIGGAN MIST is a band from Bracknell in the UK that plays Progressive Rock/Folk. If you then open the homepage of the band, you will see that they categorise themselves as a Pagan Folk Rock band. Well, let me put your mind at ease, they are both right. Icon Defaced I really like what I hear, as this is not the kind of straight forward Death Metal that just goes without nuances. Nope, if anything DEFACED loves using different influences in their music. River Of Music: The Power Of Duets - Vol. 1 Jim Peterik & World Stage What JIM PETERIK has done right is couple the right singer to his person, making all the songs sound nice from start to finish. And as usual in these genres, the musicians all have that quality that makes sure that the instrumental side of things is above reproach, that it can\u2019t be faulted. Guilty As Sin (Reissue) Brazen Abbot One thing that you can be sure of with BRAZEN ABBOT is that the songs that you will listen to are not only very well put together, properly written with a good and solid structure, but also with some good bones. Most important of all, I believe that band leader Nikolo Kotzev has chosen wisely when he was deciding who was going to sing which song. Perdition Karu \u201cPerdition\u201c is a masterclass in terms of compositions and songwriting. The album is a dark, melancholic, but also crushing delivery with well balanced orchestral arrangements and hammering, never-ending blast-beat attacks Repression Tank Dead Head \u201cRepression Tank\u201d is a gentle reminder for what DEAD HEAD stands for: pummeling Thrash Metal at blistering pace, anger, and aggression High On Fire Sainted Sinners So this is the fifth album for Sainted Sinners which has taken over three years [\u2026] When Night Falls Wicked Smile Wicked Smile are a Heavy Metal band from Melbourne Australia ,the bands mission is to [\u2026] Behind The Eclipse Course of Fate With all the strong, positive sounds and compositions on the album, and there are many, it does come with one area I believe they could improve on. That is the pacing of the songs. Too many are on the mid-tempo or even slower side, and that does bog down the album a bit. Still, that aside, it was an excellent album that combines their strong musicianship with their rock-solid songwriting skills. The Proximity Effect The Last Sound Revelation When you create instrumental music, you have to work harder because vocals and lyrics aren\u2019t there to guide you as a listener. The album title refers to is a phenomenon where directional microphones significantly boost low-frequency (bass) sounds as they get closer to the sound source, making voices sound bigger or fuller, and that\u2019s what you will find on the album. Pictures HamaSaari In sum, I found the album was inviting, like a stranger offering you a soft bed to rest on and the comfort of an oversized blanket. Tentative at first, you shuffle in from the rain and relax with a hot drink, exchanging pleasantries with them until you drift off to a restful sleep. Time Tripper Time Tripper A guilty pleasure, if you will. Bastard Skull Bastard Skull BASTARD SKULL hails from New Jersey in the USA and have just released their debut album \u201cBastard Skull\u201d at the beginning of 2025. They did that on their own accord. Now, at the end of that same year the label WormHoleDeath has picked them up and has decided that a rerelease through them is in order. And in order to add to the pleasure of the music the label decided that the addition of the EP \u201cMore Dread\u201d that came after the album was more than justified. Kali Ptolemea What I have hear with \u201cKali\u201d is the second album of this Alternative Rock band, the debut being \u201cBalanced Darkness\u201d from 2023. I haven\u2019t heard that one, but I have a feeling that is about to change, as to me what PTOLEMEA brings on \u201cKali\u201d is nothing less than interesting, and at times even bloody good. Carnival Puppeteers Stargazery I think there are enough people around to really appreciate what STARGAZERY plays in the 53 minutes that make \u201cCarnival Puppeteers\u201d. Oh, and look out for the two covers, from DIO and DEF LEPPARD. they are quite alright... Human Eclipse Urban Dream What URBAN DREAM does is make it very hard for a promotor to do their job properly, as how do you market a band that intertwines Industrial Metal, Gothic Rock, Alternative and Pop-Rock influences into everything they do. Transcendent Chaos Spirit Of Rebellion Say no more! I'm sat for\u00a0\"Transcendent Chaos.\" Ode to the Dead Fallstaff Ode to the Dead,\u00a0the newest album from brass metal pioneers from Montreal,\u00a0Fallstaff,\u00a0is interesting to say [\u2026] Gloriae Inhuman The newest album from Portuguese metal band\u00a0Inhuman, Gloriae,is very unique to say the least. With [\u2026] Through High Holy Haze St. Unholyness Metal fans of all kinds can find something in this album to enjoy from Doom to Stoner to Groove to Black, Christina touches on it all.

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

The subtitle of their debut, MMXIX \u2013 In Frigidum Lectum is Latin for In a Cold Bed\u00e2\u0080\u0094presumably an allusion to one\u2019s grave\u00e2\u0080\u0094and now, sophomore MMXXVI \u2013 Grave states that concept explicitly. This legacy in misery actually extends further into the past, as three of Dvm Spiro \u2019s four members also play in longstanding Italian doom outfit Nihili Locus .\u201d Doomed to the grave. Memories of Old \u2013 Never Stop Believing [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By ClarkKent on January 9, 2026 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Power Metal , Symphonic Metal , 27 comments \u201cSneaking in at the end of a crowded 2025, Memories of Old released their sophomore record, Never Stop Believing , hoping to fill a Fellowship -sized hole in your heart.\u201d Don\u2019t stop! Redivider \u2013 Sounds of Malice Review By Grymm on January 8, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 45 comments \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered why there aren\u2019t more bands that use palindromes as names. Think of the perfect symmetry you can get with your logo! While I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what Louisville, Kentucky\u2019s Redivider (complete with sharp, symmetrical logo!) was aiming for when they were coming up with a name, it does make them stand out in the field of bands with gory overtones, creative combinations of food/pain/sexual positions, or what-have-you.\u201d Keep \u2019em separated! Wildhunt \u2013 Aletheia Review By Andy-War-Hall on January 8, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Thrash Metal , 29 comments \u201cThe calendar turns, and what better way to celebrate the coming year than an album that sounds straight out of the late 80s? Austria\u2019s Wildhunt have been slinging out classic thrash/heavy metal since 2011, but have until this year produced only one record: 2016\u2019s Descending . Ten years is a long time to cook up a sophomore record, and Wildhunt via Jawbreaker Records boasts of \u201ca mix of detail-loving, energetic metal and epic song structures\u201d for album number two, Aletheia .\u201d\u201d Tally ho! Dawn of a Dark Age \u2013 Ver Sacrum Review By Grin Reaper on January 7, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 20 comments \u201cAs 2025 winds to a close, the depleted promo pit growls with hunger, eager for the new year and a fresh bucket o\u2019 chum. As I sift through the meager mid-December hopefuls, I detect a flash of black and silver. Snatching the promo, I discover clarinet-wielding Vittorio Sabelli and his project Dawn of a Dark Age , along with ninth album Ver Sacrum .\u201d At the end of the year is the Dark Age. Enshine \u2013 Elevation Review By Steel Druhm on January 7, 2026 in Reviews , Doom Metal , Melodic Death Metal , Progressive Metal , 57 comments An unexpected release from Enshine requires more than one review, so join Steel and Maddog as they examine the heights of Elevation . Bygone \u2013 Bygone Review By Creeping Ivy on January 7, 2026 in Reviews , Hard Rock , Heavy Metal , Psychedelic Rock , 48 comments \u201cBeing a non-native Bostonian in Beantown allows me to exercise a dispassionate objectivity towards the city\u2019s musical culture. I vicariously experience the pride of housing The Pixies but don\u2019t feel the shame of inhabiting Aerosmith Land. And yet, I\u2019m always curious about local artists who can obliterate this objectivity, making me feel proud of Boston. Bygone , a heavy metal/hard rock sextet, may be able to liberate my revolutionary heart from its Tory shackles.\u201d Wicked haad music. Angry Metal Guy\u2019s Top Ten(ish) of 2025 By Angry Metal Guy on January 6, 2026 in Blog Posts , Lists , 359 comments \u201cIn defiance of the shit burger we\u2019re all eating every day while we wait for the AI drone war to start, 2025 was my best year in a while.\u201d An oddly optimist AMG Himself has written a list. Ellende \u2013 Zerfall Review By Grin Reaper on January 5, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 68 comments \u201cHurtling into the new year with his heart on his sleeve (and bones on his shirt), Ellende \u2019s one-man maestro L.G. bids to set a high bar for 2026. Zerfall , the band\u2019s first new material since 2022, continues where Ellenbogengesellschaft left off, further polishing the allure of classically infused black metal. Conjuring comparisons to compatriots Harakiri for the Sky and Weltenbrandt , Austria\u2019s Ellende lives somewhere between post and depressive black metal.\u201d Despair is a head crab. Opia \u2013 I Welcome Thee, Eternal Sleep [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By ClarkKent on January 5, 2026 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Doom Metal , Gothic Metal , 18 comments \u201cThis stunning debut comes to us via members from across the globe\u00e2\u0080\u0094from England to Spain to Czechia to Brazil. Despite somewhat limited experience between them, the sextet plays like they\u2019ve been jamming together for decades. They bring an eclectic range of styles from their previous and current bands, from black metal to scatological heavy metal to melodic doom to gothic metal, in order to craft a gentle yet brutal piece of gothic doom metal. I would like to give a warm welcome to Opia and their powerful debut album, I Welcome Thee, Eternal Sleep .\u201d Sleep in the void.

Abism Barbie Terminator EP Right before the first time I heard ABISM\u2019s new 7\u201d, I\u2019d just finished jamming a live boot of the VELVET UNDERGROUND, and I was amazed by the freedom of the faded guitar pokes and messing around, demonstrating how bravely primitive and self-conscious they were (and which I guess is the essence of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, to be a confident dilettante). This feeling probably stuck with me when \u201cBarbie Terminator\u201d kicked in with its cacophonic guitar scraping and burst of pumping beats that meticulously, or by instinct, are set to a tempo that grabs attention and moves bodies. Then by the second song, the fuzzed guitars started playing notes that are weird, not too technically difficult but remarkable when paired with confidence and taste, because fuck it\u2014some of us do mess around with such ideas at odd hours of the day under odd circumstances and wonder whether it is okay to include them even in radikal punk songs. ABISM\u2019s new record is a straight \u201cfuck you\u201d to those thoughts, because this sounds great and it fits a hardcore song. Only four rudimental hardcore tracks reflecting the universal frame of many signature scenes\u2019 sound, with a wink to those roots that make the record sound simple and original, and which combined recall dozens of the best bands without referencing any of them. This balance is the challenge of sounding original nowadays after everybody has heard everything and still ever-wanting more of this raw power. Another highly confident \u201cfuck you\u201d is the riff of \u201cFly Away\u201d\u2026you have a four-song 7\u201d, and you dedicate a significant amount of time to summon LENNY KRAVITZ in the subconscious of your listeners? That is bold. But even the realization of this bizarre thing is not able to keep me from loving this record. I love the non-stop pogo beat and tight groove that delivers all the weird and cool guitar sounds, and the best raspy voice (familiar from the amazing GARRAPATA). Reviewer Viktor Vargyai Label Toxic State Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Atol Atol Atol Dron Dron Dron LP ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s 2023 LP Koniec Sosu Tysi\u0105ca Wysp completely threw me for a loop\u2014taut, twin-vocal Polish art-punk with a minor DOG FACED HERMANS fixation? I might as well be Pavlov\u2019s dog. Follow-up Dron Dron Dron is just as mind-warping, centering the band\u2019s anxious electronic textures and snap-tight rhythms like an alternate-timeline Hardcore -era DEVO that wound up on Ron Johnson Records alongside the EX and BIG FLAME. Opener \u201cNeon\u201d is a perfect example of the band\u2019s controlled chaos, locking straight into a staccato, mechanical groove with skittering guitar, a bass line bouncing everywhere like an errant rubber Superball, and doubled-up chants from vocalists \u0141ukasz and Agata, all of which could be panic-inducing (or just irritating) in lesser hands, but it\u2019s completely hypnotic here. Likewise, the densely knotted skronk of \u201cBlok\u201d might easily tip into prog-punk territory were it not for some wild, collapsing drum breakdowns, but when the frenetic call-and-response in \u201cP\u0142ytki Sen\u201d hits against some incessantly buzzing synth and treble-maxed guitar cutting in like the quickest of knife flicks, there\u2019s no question that ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s true objective is putting the damage back in \u201cart-damaged,\u201d and they\u2019re killing it. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Mangel / Red Wig Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Blood Cannery Olympic Blood cassette If you\u2019re in the mood for something challenging, BLOOD CANNERY\u2019s latest concept album about a man facing (possibly supernatural) beasts on the early American frontier might be exactly what you\u2019re searching for. \u201cOlympic Blood\u201d sounds like a LIGHTNING BOLT-versus-KYUSS showdown with super-fuzzed, whammy-heavy guitar shreds placed against hyperactive drums and muffled vocals. The lyrical tales of curses, attacking brutes, and violence sometimes evokes aesthetically coherent heavy punk experimentation, and sometimes skews toward \u201c Faaaar out, man!\u201d stoner excess, but it\u2019s always enjoyable. Check it out for a conceptual romp through blood, dirt, and heavy riffs. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Cheap Fix Re-Animator Blues / French Song 7\u2033 This is CHEAP FIX\u2019s debut 7\u201d. Garage punkers from your dad\u2019s days. They all play in a bunch of different bands (TRAINWRECK, ENDURO, DECEMBER BOYS) and join together on this 7\u201d for two songs sans bass guitar. This is workin\u2019 class, \u201cdone with the day job,\u201d fuzzy, bluesy shit from the constant maestros in class, Goodbye Boozy. Could be Mark Arm\u2019s cousin singing. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Goodbye Boozy Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Contrast Attitude Discharge Your Noise LP Although they have been around for more than 25 years, Discharge Your Noise is only CONTRAST ATTITUDE\u2019s second album. Needless to say, I preordered what promised to be an exercise in intensity and ferocity as soon as possible\u2014the limited version of course, out of excitement. It would be far-fetched to claim that these Mie punks have drastically changed their sound (a new drummer, Daigo from DECEIVING SOCIETY or RADIOACTIVE, did join them, though), but I have to confess that I was a little disappointed when I first played the vinyl. Of course, the high-level energy and relentless hardcore aggression, trademarks of the band\u2019s sound, are still there, but the guitar is not as distorted, if perhaps heavier, and I suppose on this LP, CONTRAST ATTITUDE cannot really be described as the crust monster they once were. As a result, probably because I was expecting that typical \u201cwall of noise\u201d bollocking like it was still 2009, I was, well, disenchanted for a bit. Listening to the LP again for this review, I realize that it is, in fact, a solid work that, once I accepted change, I was more than able to enjoy thoroughly and play air guitar to when no one is looking. The music is still as fast and punishing, the vocals as anguished and extreme, the unstoppable D-beat noize has not disappeared, but a lot of the arrangements (and generally the songwriting and the production) point to more traditional Japanese hardcore to my ears. The band even experiments with paces a little with the very punky \u201cFeeling of the Freedom\u201d and the heavier and slower \u201cDisclose Naked Myself.\u201d I feel Discharge Your Noise is in between both styles, and while it won\u2019t alienate the traditional CONTRAST ATTITUDE fans, it may actually appeal to other people who don\u2019t necessarily wear DISCLOSE pajamas (unlike me). A good record that I still wish was a little crustier. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Desolate / D-Takt & R\u00e5punk Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Dark Thoughts Highway to the End LP Six years after their last record, Philadelphia\u2019s DARK THOUGHTS have reemerged as dialed-in as ever on this brand new slab. The tunes are tight and concise, never overstaying their welcome and always getting the point across within their brief duration. Applying the poppy and speedy formula of classic SCREECHING WEASEL and RAMONES to maximum effect, the songs hit hard with relatability, realism, and hope. They\u2019re what I wished every band sounded like when I was sixteen. \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Be Lonesome\u201d is the perfect reassuring follow-up to the previous album\u2019s heartbreaking \u201cWith You,\u201d with which I positively tortured myself at the time of its release. Or is \u201cSweet Success\u201d the real happy ending? Either way, I\u2019m glad the story isn\u2019t over. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Drunken Sailor / Stupid Bag Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Flux Peace is a Lie LP Ten pogo-inducing corkers from Belgium\u2019s latest and greatest FLUX, a band that has done their homework and sounds as authentic as anything from the UK in 1982. Speed, anger, and just the right amount of snot make this a thoroughly enjoyable listen; by the halfway point of \u201cPunk Retaliation,\u201d you\u2019ll be pumping your fist and spilling your beer along to the proceedings. For fans of SAVAGEHEADS, VAXINE, and the MASSACRED. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Havana Syndrome Kill Your Brain cassette Demented synth punkers HAVANA SYNDROME are back with a quickness after dropping a demo tape in July. Look at the cover art: a brain mainlined into a computer monitor displaying a punk whose face is being eaten by his own brain! Cool. This should give you an idea of what you\u2019re in for. It\u2019s aggressive, it\u2019s fast, and the synths give the songs life through a vein of electro insanity. On songs like \u201cWrapped Boots\u201d and \u201cMind Control,\u201d the vocalist yelps and hollers like a wounded animal around pulsing guitar and synth lines. It would be easy to compare them to bands like RESEARCH REACTOR CORPORATION, but it kicks way more ass. Think LUMPY & THE DUMPERS imprinting onto members of the LOCUST. Pick this up and kill your brain. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Swimming Faith Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Lamictal Lamictal cassette OC punk slop from the future. This is a solo project from Alex Colettogents, who is associated with seizure-core spazzers GNARLES MANSON and X-ACTO. Coming out of this eight-song tape, there is some vertigo and nausea that will take a moment to wear off. Once it does, I can say that there is slight intrigue, egg-punk on 78, dysphonia, a cacophony of eight tracks all barely clocking in at six retching minutes. Is he alone in this chaos? In the end, \u201cCan\u2019t Stand My Dreams\u201d is worthy of note. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Pop Affliction Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Melkus Discografia Due LP Leipzig\u2019s MELKUS has a distinct sound of their own that really enchanted me. Fast and furious sequences that smoothly transition into melodic passages, dark and mysterious garage sounds that get better and better with each layer, and catchy hooks peeking around every corner\u2026it\u2019s one of those albums where every part flows perfectly into the next. While guitar and bass with gloriously filthy tones lock into each other to form amazing riffs, punchy drums not only accompany them but also add another layer of that explosive energy. Charismatic vocals are definitely the cherry on top of this beautiful rock\u2019n\u2019roll cake, along with the momentary bursts of ear-candy from miscellaneous instruments like saxophone, organ, and synths. The dark and gritty production style of this LP complements the band\u2019s sound flawlessly, too. I really like this one, and I\u2019m already looking forward to their next release. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label It's Eleven Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 No Idols The Fall EP Excellent hardcore punk from Baltimore\u2019s NO IDOLS, a band composed of members of ANGEL DU$T, BIB and TRUTH CULT. Muscular and tough as hell, NO IDOLS draw from Feel the Darkness -era POISON IDEA, with catchy leads and heavy riffs galore. You can hear the pedigree behind these songs; they feel a little more complete and pulled together than your usual hardcore fare. One of 2025\u2019s best 7\u201ds. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Plastika Sijamski Blizanac LP PLASTIKA is from Croatia and plays raw, hardcore punk, and Sijamski Blizanac is their ten-track full-length that delivers a noisy pummeling. Think KRIMEWATCH but faster, and oh yeah, the lyrics aren\u2019t in English, but not knowing the words in their native language really doesn\u2019t matter with how tight tracks like \u201cNervoza\u201d and \u201cKaj Sad\u201d are. PLASTIKA has a rare authenticity in their energy which makes their delivery of primitive hardcore that much more enjoyable of a listening experience. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Onesna\u017eevanje Uma Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Saints of Lorain Before We Were Saints cassette Gonna do my best to break this somewhat confusing one down and hope that I\u2019ve got my facts straight. SAINTS OF LORAIN are from Cleveland, OH and put out a digital demo in 2023. This is the second release by the band, a \u201ccollection\u201d of songs which were written by the members\u2019 former band AL & THE COHOLICS (the collection featuring a grand total of six songs). AL & THE COHOLICS formed in 1999, and when the drummer died in 2014, his brother apparently promised to keep the music alive. Fast forward to the present and the brother is the drummer of this band, and the songs that would have been lost to time are now documented. What an absolutely lovely sentiment. Never would I ever have thought that the actions of members of a long-running drunk punk/street punk/pirate-punk band would hit on sentimentality as strong as this. Musically, this is complicated, uptempo slap bass street punk. If you like songs about being drunk, being addicted to drugs, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, or sex, or you were around for the heyday of AL & THE COHOLICS, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna have a great time with this tape. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Small Doses Rodeo EP Pretty nifty record here with plenty of nuances, combining pieces of orgcore (melodic vocals paired with power-chord-driven punk songs \u00e0 la BAD RELIGION and LAGWAGON) with post-hardcore (dissonant chords, slower tempos, and throaty screams that reminds me a lot of POLAR BEAR CLUB if they had embraced more of the Dischord style). I guess you can call this post-orgcore (although I\u2019m not even sure if that term is in vogue anymore). Well-crafted tracks that do a great job telling a narrative\u2014both musically and lyrically\u2014that never once gets boring. Great work here. As far as punk goes, this is as perfect of an EP as you\u2019ll get. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Sn\u00f6rkler Hot Dignity Dog and Other Future Classics cassette Spastic egg-punk is what y\u2019all might call SN\u00d6LKER nowadays, but it was called Very Small Records-esqe back before that term was around. It has all the perfect elements of FALSE SACRAMENT, SCHLONG, NONMEANSNO, or VICTIMS FAMILY, with keyboards for all the sulphur egginess you can handle. Four tunes that clock in under nine minutes, all plopped onto a cassette tape. The coughing on the tune \u201cVape Man\u201d is perfect. Also, I think I\u2019m hearing a flute layered in here. What the fuck is this gorgeous tidal wave of gross perfection called, you ask? I guess it\u2019s called SN\u00d6RKLER. Reviewer Tony Party Label What's For Breakfast? Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 TV Casualties Orphanage Fire CD Self-proclaimed \u201cCanola Hardcore,\u201d whatever the hell that means. This sounds like a band that you saw on the Warped Tour when you were thirteen years old whose name you can\u2019t remember. The EP is self-produced and self-released which is commendable, but the songs are generic and unmemorable. You could put it on in the background and no one will be offended, but no one\u2019s going to ask you who it is, either. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Zlodzieje Rowerow Ka\u017cdy Inny Wszyscy R\u00f3wni EP Melodic yet confrontational punk rock from Poland, rooted in DIY ethics and social awareness. ZLODZIEJE ROWEROW delivers mid-tempo anthems with heartfelt vocals and strong choruses, balancing aggression and melody with ease. The lyrics emphasize equality and solidarity, making this EP both politically charged and emotionally resonant. Punk rock mel\u00f3dico y combativo desde Polonia, con una fuerte base DIY y conciencia social. ZLODZIEJE ROWEROW presentan himnos de medio tiempo con coros s\u00f3lidos y voces cargadas de emoci\u00f3n, equilibrando agresi\u00f3n y melod\u00eda con naturalidad. Las letras giran en torno a la igualdad y la solidaridad, logrando un EP tan pol\u00edtico como emotivo. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Refuse Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 V/A Right on Time Re:imagined LP I try to refrain from using the phrase \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d when writing about music (in real life, I may not apologize enough). But in this case, I can\u2019t conceive of any other way to rationalize how I feel about what I\u2019m duty-bound to say. Right on Time Re:imagined is easily the worst release I\u2019ve had to suffer through listening to in a long, long time. Each and every song is bad, some extraordinarily so. What we have here are six versions of the same song, interpreted by different artists in distinct genres spanning the gamut from \u201cSexy Stoner Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll\u201d to \u201cEmo Pop Punk\u201d and \u201cHeavenly Metal.\u201d There\u2019s even an \u201cUnplugged Hardcore\u201d rendition that is more egregious than whatever you\u2019re imagining. The song that is the basis for such wide and varied explication is a by-the-numbers youth crew ditty called \u201cRight on Time.\u201d As a stand-alone track, it\u2019s a decent slice of impassioned straightedge hardcore, with a message that offers genuine positivity in the face of adversity. And herein lies the source of my initial plea for forgiveness\u2026this whole project is inspired by a member of the band RIGHT ON TIME\u2019s battle against cancer, and is an ode to the support they received from friends in the darkest moments of that experience. Profits from this release support a Dutch foundation, No Guts No Glory, that is dedicated to making the music-related wishes of cancer patients come true. Truly a fantastic cause, and one that I do not wish to denigrate just because I don\u2019t like the music involved. If you dig sXe hardcore and have broad enough interests, this may be right up your alley. In any case, there\u2019s a worthy cause attached to this that makes my snarky take on the tunes irrelevant. Fuck cancer! Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Positive and Focused Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 100 Flowers Presence of Mind EP reissue Shortly after the URINALS changed their name to 100 FLOWERS, they cemented the switch with the release of this artsy 7\u201d in 1982. A bit more explorational than their earlier output, which brought us dum-dum classics like \u201cI\u2019m A Bug\u201d and \u201cAck Ack Ack Ack,\u201d the band\u2019s evolved style on this three-song EP is more in line with the sound of early WIRE and PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED. The dark disco of the title track leads the proceedings, an energetic post-punk number that would eventually make its way onto the group\u2019s LP the following year. Next up, the brief and bouncy \u201cDyslexia\u201d quickly reminds us that we\u2019re still dealing with the same guys that wrote \u201cI Am White and Middle Class.\u201d On the flipside, \u201cMop Dub\u201d is an instrumental backwards treatment of \u201cPresence of Mind,\u201d providing a symmetrical bookend that suits the fashion of the era. Faithfully reissued in its original format, this poignant little slab documents the iconic unit\u2019s transition from weird to weirder. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Spacecase Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Axe Il Cimitero \u00e8 Dappertutto cassette Italy\u2019s Sistema Mortal has had an excellent year, starting off with the head-splitting FARCE 7\u201d and wrapping things up with this killer debut from Milan\u2019s AXE. Featuring two vocalists and a raw, crusty sound, AXE plays with a little more texture and melody (and I think keyboard) than your usual D-beat fare. Opening track \u201cPatto di Sangue\u201d kicks off with an ominously dark tone that quickly morphs into full on m\u00e4ngel fury that doesn\u2019t let up for the entirety of the tape. A total scorcher and highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Sistema Mortal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Billiam The Letter W & the Numeral B EP Melbourne\u2019s BILLIAM is back with another EP, his fourth release this year. There\u2019s nothing new here, and any of the four tracks could have appeared on any of the project\u2019s previous efforts. If you\u2019ve enjoyed any of his other records, you\u2019ll dig this. \u201cNew Wave\u201d and \u201cHouston We Have Rock\u201d are full of fuzzy three-chord punk, battered with synthesizers and left scrambling to catch up to the lo-fi hi-hats working overtime in the background. The vocals sound like they were recorded through a cell phone inside of a cave, which kind of ruins it for me, although repeating the phrase \u201cHouston, we have rock\u201d 16 times in 54 seconds brought a smile to my face. The B-side is more mid-tempo and features the highlight of the EP for me, the closing \u201cEssential Feedstock Oils,\u201d where they repeat the word \u201crecord\u201d 27 times in 90 seconds. Heavy SPARKS vibes with a bedroom charm. It ain\u2019t for me, but fans of 1-800-MIKEY and GEE TEE will eat it up. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Low Ambition Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 C.A.M.O. Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry 12\u2033 If you played this for me and told me it came out in 1985, I\u2019d believe you, but C.A.M.O. out of Vienna, Austria exists in 2025, and thanks to Mendeku Diskak, their cassette Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry is now available as a vinyl disc. Anarcho-punk with a cold bent makes C.A.M.O. sound indignant and haunting, and this eight-song album is full of sonic macabre with ominous lyrics and guitar riffs that sound adjacent to funeral marches. If you dig early KILLING JOKE, 1919, or PART1, then go check out C.A.M.O. right now. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Condumb Disassociation EP Crasher-crust noise punk from Philadelphia. It\u2019s a well-crafted 7\u201d where both the songwriting and the smart usage of the classic pedal arsenal are strong\u2014there is a good balance between fast- and mid-tempos, and the screaming vocals let the songs breathe but sound forceful when they\u2019re happening. The songs are so well-written that they would work without the screaming/swirling jet sounds of the guitar, which in could go against the noise-not-music ethos within the record, as the added effects are not masking rather traditional songs but upgrading primitive, non-existent ideas to something truly otherworldly. Here, the noise is masking knowledge and talent if you let yourself lead into mindless headbanging (which the record offers), but if you arrive via the main bands of the members, you probably will not feel cheated, either. Or if you listen beyond aesthetics and pay attention to what is actually happening. Nowadays, the look and slogans of this style seem more popular than ever, yet most bands do not come close to getting the essence of this sound. CONDUMB does; they get it and do it just right. Reviewer Viktor Vargyai Label Stupid Bag Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dead Bug 6 or 12 New Songs cassette NYC/Richmond, CA duo DEAD BUG\u2019s 6 or 12 New Songs is not really an album, but more of an experiment on interpreting visual data and translating it into music. It goes like this: there is a zine called 5 New Songs which has cryptic drawings and enigmatic descriptions that symbolize abstract ideas for five different songs. Both members of the band work alone to write and record their respective sides with their interpretation of what those songs would sound like. The results are really interesting and it\u2019s definitely a thought-provoking experiment. But I think reviewing and trying to describe how it sounds would defeat its purpose, as it requires listeners to connect the dots between the music and the visuals. I highly recommend checking it out and maybe even trying it yourself. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Embittered This Failed Endeavor cassette Raw, pissed-off hardcore punk with a distinctly bleak tone. EMBITTERED tears through short, furious tracks driven by urgent drumming and a bitter vocal delivery. The cassette format suits the band perfectly\u2014lo-fi but powerful, emphasizing frustration, alienation, and total rejection of false optimism. Hardcore meant to be felt, not polished. Hardcore punk crudo y cargado de bronca, con un tono marcadamente sombr\u00edo. Embittered avanzan a trav\u00e9s de canciones cortas y furiosas, impulsadas por una bater\u00eda urgente y voces cargadas de resentimiento. El formato cassette le sienta perfecto al material: sonido \u00e1spero, directo, enfocado en la frustraci\u00f3n y el rechazo absoluto al optimismo vac\u00edo. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Hey Fuck You Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Fungas Intelligence 1 LP Sci-fi egg-punk from Australia that mixes DEVO-core vocals and herky-jerky rhythms with maximum dork power (they\u2019re really into rocks, apparently?). Sneaky spy riffs tangle with alien synths for a familiar but fun high-energy blast. \u201ci1\u201d pulls back the shtick just a bit to allow classic new wave melodies to emerge and build a near-perfect multi-layered pop song. If you like this kind of stuff, you\u2019ll like this record\u2014it\u2019s well-produced and carefully composed for maximum party impact. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Erste Theke Tontr\u00e4ger Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Holly and the Nice Lions Dolores LP I went to Green Bay UFO Museum Gift Shop and Records for the first time a few years ago when I decided to drive the northern route around Lake Michigan to Minneapolis. I walked out of there with some great records on Amphetamine Reptile and a Darth Vader bank for my cousin that would activate with every road bump and say \u201cImpressive, most impressive, you are not a Jedi yet.\u201d There were a lot of bumps. Still, with that slap-tickle memory, I was excited to see that they had something to do with this release. I researched (typed into an Internet browser) Certified PR Records and found that they are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, where long-ago Maximum Rocknroll shitworker, reviewer, columnist, and interviewer Lali D lives, so it can\u2019t be that bad. I heard that St. Pete has a good glass arts scene, too. This Dolores LP starts off with a song clocking in at over four minutes, pulling from the dark side of the dirge-like, cloud-covered Midwest, but around the two-minute mark, it becomes a straight-up middle-finger rocker. This easily could have been on Sympathy for the Record Industry with its lean into the punk side of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. The standout on this is the HOLLY part of HOLLY AND THE NICE LIONS band, and her direct and committed vocals. Oftentimes I\u2019ve felt that singers can tend to overdo it with screaming to try and get across their disgust or pain or anger, but in this instance, HOLLY uses good songwriting coupled with subtle vocal tones and inflection to let you know she\u2019s had enough. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t touch on Steven Spoerl\u2019s bass-playing that complements every song, almost as though another dim and somber conversation is taking place somewhere in the same room, with Travis Pashek\u2019s drums pulling you forward through a late-night drive north, hugging the lake shore alone with everything getting darker and darker. This record, in sum, is thoughtful, heavy, dark, empowering, sorrowful, and redeeming rock\u2019n\u2019roll/punk/sludge/garage. Dolores is for those times that you want to be alone to work out what\u2019s been bugging you. HOLLY AND THE NICE LIONS have been a band for over a decade, and I\u2019m a bit sad that I\u2019m just hearing them now. In closing, my cousin loved his Darth Vader bank, and think he\u2019s going to love this record, too. He\u2019s 53. Reviewer Tony Party Label Certified PR / Green Bay UFO Museum Gift Shop and Records Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Industry Industry LP Berlin-based INDUSTRY has been gathering steam from the past two years and has finally unleashed their self-titled full-length. Burly punk rock with jazz compositions and an aggro vibe creates a ten-song LP that reads as monolithic but is overtly so much more. In other words, lyrics born out of exasperation are delivered over rumbling rhythms and grinding guitars that shift grooves frequently, but always seem to get your head banging. If you\u2019ve had your fill of AXEGRINDER and are looking for something more, then look no further than INDUSTRY. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label La Vida Es Un Mus Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Lake Inferior Five Ahead / Avoid All Robots 7\u2033 Wow, this is a phenomenal pair of songs here. Sinister doom-goth-surf rock, as if WEEDEATER decided they wanted to sound more like the CRAMPS and Danzig-era MISFITS. I love the unintentional (at least I assume it\u2019s unintentional) irony of their song \u201cFive Ahead,\u201d which features the lyrics \u201cFive years ahead of our time / Ten years behind.\u201d This certainly sounds like it\u2019s from the future and not at all dated or \u201cbehind.\u201d The B-side (\u201cAvoid All Robots\u201d) is equal parts retro-futuristic and a cautionary tale for our current AI-addled society. Really great slab here. Highly recommended. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Model Martel A Thousand Couple Times LP MODEL MARTEL has a parallel sound with many bands on Tiny Engines Records and the Lauren Records style of Midwest-centric emo-punk-pop-core. This is shitty jobs, friends you can\u2019t depend on, broken relationships, expecting more from life, and finding comfort in late night talks, all wrapped in guitar hooks and melancholic melody. If I were 25 years younger, I would be calling this my favorite record of 2025 because of how it encapsulates life\u2019s twenties and thirties. A solid, lyrically-focused rite of passage LP, open-eyed on broken and healing, punctuated with tight bass and drums. There are only 300 of these LPs, on all of the different colors that an LP could be, perhaps. A Thousand Couple Times , although budding with infectious hooks, has a regretful and foreboding lyrical sorrow to it that always seems to be amplified by a band\u2019s proximity to the Great Lakes. Reviewer Tony Party Label Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Not This Record Contains Not One Hit Single\u2026 + I Do Not Care!!! CD Off-kilter Japanese punkers NOT existed in the early 2000s, sticking around for just long enough to record the thirteen rough-hewn tracks showcased on this CD. Injecting straightforward \u201977 punk in the vein of the KNOCKS with a bit of modern meddle like the BLACK AND WHITE, the band\u2019s sound is ultimately a quirky take on \u201990s garage punk style. The opening groove to \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Back to Me\u201d is a straight-up REGISTRATORS swipe, and the winding instrumental \u201cMituwadai 101\u201d sounds like it could be a GASOLINE jam session captured in uncharacteristically clean fidelity. Tracks one through eight are from the band\u2019s most realized recording, titled This Record Contains Not One Hit Single , and the remaining songs are taken from their 2004 demo ( I Do Not Care ), bringing you the full NOT experience on one disc. A brief interview with the group\u2019s founder Hidde included in this package alludes to a reunion gig slated for 2026, so keep an eye out if you happen to find yourself in Chiba prefecture this coming year. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Private Scandal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dre Perish Twist of Fate LP New Orleans artist/producer DRE PERISH (also of the noise punk duo QUARTER RATS) is a self-styled \u201cpsych punk/no wave junkie,\u201d and their new LP seems to push that identity in every direction at once. PERISH handles vocals, guitar, bass, synths, sax, beats, and samples, with guest players dropping in on about half the tracks. Across its eleven songs and three field recordings, the album meanders between styles like a Tuesday-night CBGB audition lineup: opening with a NINE INCH NAILS-leaning opener, then a detour into alternative/art rock, the rumble of a passing train, and then \u201cAll Night!\u201d\u2014the standout for me, which sounds like it could\u2019ve come off one of the more chaotic OSEES recordings. There\u2019s also a crunchy/synthy cover of GANG OF FOUR\u2019s \u201cTo Hell With Poverty!\u201d I found myself gravitating toward the tracks played with real instruments and patiently waiting for the synth-heavy ones to end, but that\u2019s just personal taste. For most people, this will either be a challenging listen or a novelty, but if you\u2019ve got a wide-open brain and enjoy listening to an artist follow every weird instinct, Twist of Fate might be an entertaining journey. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Primitive Postures / Strange Daisy Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Precipice Down the Well 12\u2033 PRECIPICE is a band that formed during COVID and put out a demo that I heard yet quickly lost interest in. Down the Well is a welcomed return, and is demonstrative of the Nantes group strengthening and turning the knobs. Bass-driven in an almost KILLDOZER-like way, the eight tracks are spread evenly with hate and indignation. A minute-long beatdown with \u201cA Customary Behavior in a Particular Situation\u201d is my mixtape track. Good bruisers. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Discos Enfermos / Urticaria Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Royal Scum Human Gallantry EP This is a perfect example of a cover being a poor illustration of the music included on the record. In terms of semiotics, using a rather gruesome black-and-white picture of a horse being hung on a deck points to growling, nihilistic grindcore, but ROYAL SCUM from Hamburg does not belong to that school, rather playing heavy and dark crusty hardcore with some moody melodies. The band is actually more of a collective and does not have a fixed lineup, so I do not know if the members of this version of the band were around in the \u201900s, but I would bet they were because ROYAL SCUM has that typical quite well-produced neocrusty sound that was so popular back then. It would be far-fetched to claim that they stand as an all-out FROM ASHES RISE-type band, but early/mid-\u201900s ACURSED or UNKIND come to mind, although they do not sound quite as bleak, and the vocal delivery in English\u2014as well as the use of several angry singers\u2014makes me think of US bands (like ANTIPRODUCT, maybe?). With ROYAL SCUM being pro-vegan, I assume the cover is meant to reflect human cruelty toward animals, and I would guess the band is not too keen on the monarchy (even if Germany, besides Franz Beckenbauer, has not had a king for a while). On the whole, Human Gallantry is a pretty solid listen if you enjoy this sort of politically-driven, heavy, angry hardcore with dark melodies, and the EP works well and does perfectly what it set out to do. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Aktiver Ausstand In Plastik / Bolzkow / Frontcore / Zann's Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Slang Rest in Misery LP Sapporo City legends return after a decade of silence with all the subtlety of a bomb blast. Stoke-on-Trent meets NYHC in a glorious amalgamation that still sounds fresh and innovative over thirty years on. The vitality and rage hasn\u2019t faded in the least, and one gets the sense that SLANG has reemerged in response to the deteriorating global political climate. In the face of so much avoidable death and exploitation, the outrage laid bare across the nine tracks of Rest in Misery is palpable. Prank isn\u2019t as active as they once were, but they always deliver the goods. No exception here, just raging Japanese hardcore with a metallic bent that will make you want to run through a wall. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Prank Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Stare Kits Live in NYC 1979 LP STARE KITS were an enigmatic, art-leaning minimalist punk quartet that operated on the periphery of New York\u2019s late \u201970s no wave scene\u2014their first show was actually on a May 1979 bill with the similarly-disposed (and also debuting) UT, two strange and striking flowers simultaneously sprouting from the same overgrown garden plot. It turned out to be an incredibly short-lived project (six whole months and three live performances), with a legacy that has largely survived through the web of what its members would later go onto to do, namely vocalist Angela Jaeger relocating to London and joining DROWNING CRAZE and PIGBAG after STARE KITS\u2019 split and drummer Amy Rigby forming the SHAMS in the late \u201980s before a lauded singer/songwriter career. This LP marks the first proper STARE KITS release, with Side A pulled from live tracks recorded at two of the band\u2019s three gigs at the Lower Manhattan post-punk/experimental music hub Tier 3 and rehearsal versions of six of those eight songs making up the flip. The raw, feral energy of the live takes gives them an almost universal edge here\u2014\u201c\u200bIf It\u2019s Red It Can\u2019t Be Black\u201d is STARE KITS at their most classically no wave, as Angela\u2019s vocals waver somewhere between spoken, sung, and incanted over a completely tumbling and halting rhythm, while the doomed guitar-and-poetry intensity of \u201cI See Them From My Window\u201d almost prefigures MECCA NORMAL, and standout \u201cStrength Accumulate\u201d strips bass-driven, UK DIY-style post-punk to an absolutely paper-thin extreme. A footnote in the grand scheme of things, to be sure, but still one worth investigating. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Feeding Tube / Negative Glam Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Twenty One Children Ice Cube EP Scrappy, hook-driven punk rock with garage energy and a sneering attitude. TWENTY ONE CHILDREN balance raw distortion with catchy songwriting, keeping things loose but memorable. The EP moves fast, loaded with youthful frustration and sharp humor, recalling classic underground punk while still sounding fresh. A solid reminder that simple punk done right still hits hard. Punk rock directo y pegadizo, con energ\u00eda garage y actitud burlona. TWENTY ONE CHILDREN combinan distorsi\u00f3n cruda con canciones memorables, manteniendo todo simple pero efectivo. El EP avanza r\u00e1pido, cargado de frustraci\u00f3n juvenil y humor \u00e1cido, evocando el punk underground cl\u00e1sico sin sonar pasado de moda. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Slovenly Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Wax Static Wasted Town EP The cover is a picture of a broken skateboard with the band name in \u201990s labelmaker font, and there\u2019s a PRIMITIVE HEARTS cover included. I love it when a band lets you know exactly what to expect from their cover art. There\u2019s a lo-f surfy element to these songs, but it\u2019s still a little tough while still being fun. Both \u201cWasted Town\u201d and \u201cBack to You\u201d have an early BLACK LIPS feel to them and pair well with the PRIMITIVE HEARTS cover. The vocals are much more audible and in the mix than on their demo released in early 2025, and it benefits them well. Worth checking out if you\u2019re into lo-fi bedroom garage punk. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Blank Step Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Yellow Ghoul Yellow Ghoul cassette Solid five-track debut from Buffalo punks YELLOW GHOUL, featuring grimy and lo-fi(-ish) guitars accompanied by pounding drums and vocals by SCIENCE MAN\u2019s John Toohill. YELLOW GHOUL speeds through these songs, slowing down for a breakdown or two but not much else. Overall, I have no complaints here; this sounds like something Toxic State would put out, which is as high a compliment as I can pay. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Swimming Faith Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 V/A Slice of Death cassette Tennessee Cold Cuts have had one hell of a busy year, dropping some of the best albums I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reviewing over these last 365 days. This comp will give you a great taste of what this label has to offer, with tracks ranging from egg-punk to goth rock, dance punk to brutal grindcore. This is a fantastically eclectic mix and definitely worth a couple plays. Tennessee\u2019s punk scene is looking mighty strong heading into 2026. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Tennessee Cold Cuts Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Angel Face Out in the Street LP If you\u2019re a fan of garage punk and this isn\u2019t already on your radar, then no, you\u2019re not. Distributed via the gold standard Slovenly and featuring members of TEENGENERATE and the FADEAWAYS, this exemplifies what makes the genre exciting. The hooks are incredible and the production presents the whole affair within crackling gritty trappings. These players have power pop chops for decades, but they\u2019re so tuned in here and pushed into the red that they have major teeth track to track. Background \u201cooh\u201ds and \u201cahh\u201ds are guiding stars of style, as well as handclaps that inflect a bubblegum tone that bumps nicely against the spikier edges of what\u2019s going on. This group\u2019s debut was good stuff, but this is a whole other level. The B-side standout \u201cPress Your Luck\u201d has STOOGES\u2019 dripping venom with a chorus that\u2019s downright gorgeous. The album is undeniable, so don\u2019t try and fight it off and let it take over your turntable. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Slovenly Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Banda Des Femer Her\u00e8ncia Enverinada 12\u2033 It\u2019s the first time I get assigned a band singing in Menorcan Catalan, which is a specific type of Catalan from the Balearic Islands, and if the language is new to me, the music certainly is not, because BANDA DES FEMER play good old raw, k\u00e4ng-influenced hardcore punk that takes no prisoners and gets straight to the point. What sets this LP apart might be the peculiar production that keeps things deceptively simple and primitive\u2014it doesn\u2019t go for any deafening \u201cwall of noise\u201d or anything fancy, but just old school D-beat punk for the punks (a noble cause indeed). The band clearly displays self-awareness about the genre and their own technical prowess, which I find quite refreshing. I like the upfront vocals that are still intelligible, and there are some welcome mid-paced moments and even a couple of sing-alongs. There are strong hints of \u201990s D-beat and some songs would have been at home on a Distortion Records compilation in 1994. The music also reminds me of DHK for its spontaneity and its radicalism, not synonymous with extremity here but of core value. Simple, fast, and loud political hardcore punk that loves DISCHARGE lovers. However, I think the record should have been longer, as seven songs in fourteen minutes is a little short for an album (although the three members do not live in the same town, so practicing has to be an issue), but these are fourteen good minutes. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Diy Kontraatak / Korc Edicions / Plastic Wound / Todo Roto / Wrong Disk / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 [Brick] Demo 2025 cassette Visceral and vitriolic, the UK\u2019s [BRICK] are angry and have good reason to be. Existing in a world that rejects you at every turn is unimaginable, but that is indeed their reality. As a group of trans women (who met at a transfeminist book club, awesome), [BRICK]\u2019s songs speak to the very real hate faced by trans people every day. Sonically, it\u2019s a lo-fi and straightforward punk affair, occasionally going off the rails into discordant noise territory. Lyrically, it\u2019s a brutal listen, but one that deserves to be heard. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Covids Pay No Mind LP The COVIDS have an UNDERTONES quality to their songs while drawing in a more modern song structure influenced by Goner Records\u2019 roster of catchier bands, the Rev. N\u00f8rb, and bands blending the METHADONES and RAMONES. \u201cWaste of Space\u201d is my favorite track on the record simply because of the way they cadence the chorus of \u201cspace and time\u201d with space and time; it will make sense when you hear it. There are ten songs rounding out this LP, making this a perfect length. I think I\u2019m most pleased by the front and back of the sleeve because it gives you a near-perfect idea of what this band is like just by the color and composition, and the sunglasses on the back made me giggle. Reviewer Tony Party Label Wap Shoo Wap Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Drags Dragsploitation\u2026 Now! LP One of three well-deserved DRAGS reissues delivered by Total Punk this year, Dragsploitation\u2026 Now! is a brief and potent ride through the band\u2019s legendary \u201960s-fueled punk swagger in its earlier stages. Originally released as a 10\u201d by Estrus in 1995, this was their sophomore effort following the iconic I Like to Die 7\u201d. Alongside the MAKERS, THEE HEADCOATS, and a handful of others, these guys forged the throwback garage style of the \u201990s, offering an eye-opening take on punk for impressionable youth of that era (including yours truly.) Dig that crazy beat\u2014it still feels fresh 30 years later. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Total Punk Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Endless Joy Endless Joy LP Iron Lung hits the mark once again, delivering another masterclass in abrasive, high-stakes hardcore. ENDLESS JOY plays with tension and dissonance like a weapon\u2014jagged riffs, frantic delivery, and a suffocating, anxious energy that never lets up. Every song feels like it\u2019s on the verge of imploding, yet the band maintains complete control, which is exactly what makes it so powerful. Easily one of the strongest releases of the batch. Iron Lung no falla, y este LP es otra prueba de su punter\u00eda quir\u00fargica. ENDLESS JOY ejecuta un hardcore desquiciado, tenso y abrasivo, donde la disonancia funciona como motor emocional. Los temas avanzan como un enjambre el\u00e9ctrico: r\u00e1pidos, inc\u00f3modos y llenos de esquinas filosas. Todo suena al borde del colapso pero siempre bajo control, lo que lo vuelve a\u00fan m\u00e1s poderoso. Uno de los discos m\u00e1s fuertes del mes. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Fuzz Bombers The Fuzz Bombers cassette reissue The FUZZ BOMBERS were a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-them San Gabriel Valley band active circa 1998, built from ex-members of the JAWAS and future members of the TAKEDOWNS and BAD MOTIVATOR, among others\u2014basically the extended universe of singer/label-runner Brian Von Wolfe. This tape pulls together two sessions from that year, and the results are classic no-budget garage punk: fast, loose, and sounding slightly better than recorded-on-a-boombox. There\u2019s an early version of \u201cGet Out Of,\u201d later re-recorded by the TAKEDOWNS, but this one is faster and a shade more raw. None of this rewrites the genre playbook, but it\u2019s a perfectly decent document of late-\u201990s punk ephemera. Maybe essential if you\u2019re trying to fill out the Brian-adjacent family tree; otherwise, it\u2019s probably not going to have a huge impact on anybody. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Wolf on a Bridge Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 High Anxiety Your Dreams Are Caught in War 12\u2033 HIGH ANXIETY from Ontario, Canada plays crust-blown anarcho-punk, and earlier this year, they released Your Dreams Are Caught in War , which is ten tracks of indignation and rage. Espousing post-crust and proto-grind elements, HIGH ANXIETY features noisy vocals, upfront, dirty bass, and guitar riffs that are primitive, rhythmic, and energetic. Lyrically, HIGH ANXIETY cuts through the bullshit with scathing criticisms of political, cultural, and religious institutions of our time. The ten songs on this disc are over in much too short of an amount of time, leading to multiple playthroughs. Your Dreams are Caught in War is a joint release of Fiadh Productions and Violet Hour Transmissions, so the sleeve and disc are of the highest quality. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Fiadh Productions / Violet Hour Transmissions Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Icks Devil cassette Second five-song cassette released by this Florida three-piece punk outfit. Similar to the first tape, this follow-up is almost painfully lo-fi. Unfortunately, this does detract a bit from the songs, making it difficult to discern exactly what\u2019s going on. While I find the attempt to do an analog recording right onto a stereo tape deck incredibly commendable (and a hell of a lot more real than doing a crummy cell-phone-recorded demo), there is a learning curve and obvious limitations with such an approach. In terms of the songs themselves, the first three are driving, mid-tempo grunge-inspired punk songs with somewhat lazy vocal delivery, \u201cNice Things\u201d being the clear standout of the bunch. From here, the tape changes lanes completely, bringing us an artistic, quirky spoken word/bass interlude, and finally an acoustic, open-mic-style bedroom pop song. All in all, I\u2019m just left more confused than anything else after listening to this release. Oh, also, having to do research to figure out that a release is on a tape label is a bizarre move. Why wouldn\u2019t the label releasing something just put their label name somewhere on the tape or the artwork? Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Ragdoll Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Jailcell Recipes Artifact for an Empty Tank World LP A reissue compilation encompassing the first two full-lengths and first two EPs from hardcore Wiganers JAILCELL RECIPES. The target for this collection was to clean up poor-quality old recordings to be introduced amongst a teeming new audience. Did it work? Yes, it did. The traversing collection starts with the band in their heavily YOUTH OF TODAY-influenced genesis and ends with the band\u2019s LEATHERFACE-styled coda. Tons of material is crammed into this record sleeve, really everything there could be to know about these blokes.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis.

The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get.

The band keeps dynamics to a gentle hush; Ammons plays his melody lines straight, keeping embellishments to a bare minimum. Still, the ear can\u2019t help but single out Ammons\u2019 tenor sax. His tone is unmistakable: deep, rich, and warm. He doesn\u2019t so much play notes as he breathes his soul into them, tinting each legato phrase with a lifetime\u2019s worth of dreams and regrets. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Talk Talk :: Spirit of Eden Some records feel impossible to write about. Not because they lack substance, but because they possess too much of it: too much quiet, too much space, too much mystery. They resist language the way water resists a net. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together In 1976 the granola jazzists teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in the sphere, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Jon Hassell / Brian Eno :: Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics The music winds sinuously, like a river in deep, humid tropics. In six tracks which blend seamlessly into one musical entity, this pivotal collaboration from Brian Eno and Jon Hassell explores a mystical, minimalist music, tinted by Southern Hemisphere sounds but also incorporating 20th century electronics. The cuts move slowly but insistently, a sensuous wiggle in their syncopation. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Will Epstein :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on January 9, 2026 January 8, 2026 Throughout his career, Will Epstein has amassed film scoring credits, including an IDA Documentary Award nomination for his score for Nam June Paik: Moon Is The Oldest TV (2023), by attuning to the micro-moments on screen and crafting the music to match them. So it comes as no surprise that, with the release of his latest lyrics-forward album Yeah, mostly (out on Fat Possum Records), he applies this focused attention as well, sourcing his imagery and subject matter from life\u2019s small moments that may otherwise go unnoticed as a person goes on living. David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar Jazz Posted on January 8, 2026 January 7, 2026 Released 10 years ago today, David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar marked the artist\u2019s most intensive and rewarding collaboration with jazz musicians in the span of his six decade career. To commemorate the album\u2019s anniversary we dive into how his work with Maria Schneider, Donny McCaslin and other players shaped his final record. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on January 7, 2026 January 7, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W It\u2019s Common Knowledge I\u2019ve Been Doin\u2019 Alright: Dan Bejar on \u201cDestroyer\u2019s Rubies\u201d at 20 Posted on January 7, 2026 January 7, 2026 Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Released two decades ago in February of 2006, we caught up with Bejar to discuss all of it \u2026 Elijah Minnelli :: Clams As A Main Meal Posted on January 6, 2026 January 6, 2026 After garnering a reputation for his curated global radio mixes, London-based sound alchemist Elijah Minnelli pieces together a singular fusion of folk, offbeat dub and Cumbia rhythms on sophomore album Clams As A Main Meal . The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Robert Stillman :: 10,000 Rivers Posted on January 6, 2026 January 5, 2026 We live in a world birthed from the techno-utopian visions of people like Apple founder Steve Jobs, who\u2019s the subject of East Kent composer and The Smile collaborator Robert Stillman\u2019s remarkable new album 10,000 Rivers . Synthesizing a web of jazz, smooth \u201980s sounds and modern classical into a whole that works as a provocation, humanizing investigation, and critique all at once. Miguel G\u00f3es :: Pequenas Lembran\u00e7as Posted on January 5, 2026 January 2, 2026 Miguel G\u00f3es debuts his solo project with one of Brazil\u2019s most exciting new cosmic jazz releases, Pequenas Lembran\u00e7as . In this short but erudite instrumental work, you can hear the post-bop psychedelia of Yusef Lateef and Pharoah Sanders, the pop circuses of Van Dyke Parks and John Cale, the ethnological classical of Bartok and Debussy, as well as figures from the contemporary West Coast scene of atmospheric jazz, alongside Carlos Ni\u00f1o or Fabiano do Nascimento. Dry Cleaning :: Secret Love Posted on January 5, 2026 January 2, 2026 Produced by\u00a0Cate Le Bon, Secret Love is the\u00a0London four-piece\u2019s third and best album to date \u2014 a volatile concoction of hot and cold, rough and smooth. Intellectually rigorous and physically moving, there\u2019s a simmering tension in even the coolest temperature lyrics The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on December 31, 2025 January 3, 2026 New year, new you.

As with any good NYE party, it\u2019s equal parts awesome, boozy and occasionally chaotic. Hit play at 10:30pm on December 31 and you can time it just right to hear JJ Cale welcome you to 1976. Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together Posted on December 29, 2025 December 28, 2025 The eclectic instrumental quartet Oregon didn\u2019t have a drummer, and didn\u2019t need one, letting Collin Walcott\u2019s hand percussion punctuate their inventive collective approach to rhythm and timekeeping. But in 1976, they teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in jazz, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
