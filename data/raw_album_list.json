The intensity never lets up, and it sounds like they are unearthing Hell itself on the album. Nothingman Age of Ruin Hair metal, thrasher, metal core, and all the beauty wrapped into one. Age of Ruin is setting the bar high for other bands trying to make a name of themselves. Down in Flames Glasgow Kiss Glasgow Kiss, where have they been my entire life? Apparently writing Down In Flames for our listening pleasure! In Absence of Light All We Leave Behind Doom Metal can be very exciting. This album was just average in the annals of the genre. Too many of its 11 songs sounded too close to one another, and that is my main issue with the album as a reviewer. To Carry On Morke As far as \u201cTo Carry On\u201d goes, a well-written, well-executed album. Recommended for any fan of Atmospheric or Melodic Black Metal. Solitude Nordicwinter This was a solid album to listen to, combining the aggressiveness of Black Metal vocals with the sheer depression that can also be prevalent in the genre. After listening, I have this contemplative feeling that makes me want to leave my responsibilities behind for a while and really think some things through. Endless Nights Empire Drowns Overall, the album has great balance\u2026each instrument like the keys, guitars, bass, vocals, and drums work together in a synergy that is hard to find. This was a terrific album, expertly combining the genres of Doom, Death, and Melo-Death together to create a sound of anguish, pain, even terror at times, but all done with a melodic touch. Communion in Anguish Tithe Coming from Portland , Oregon, which is a town several atmospheric,\u00a0 and very interesting bands [\u2026] Red Hill Murmur Pain? Yes, you will feel its sharp bite. Anger? Yes, you will feel its fire raging inside of you. The three songs carried a lot of emotion along with them, and like adding salt to a wound, they can easily revive any latent feelings you have tried to push down and lock away. This was an excellent release, and I would love to hear more. The Ship//The Sea Beastwars Hailing from Wellington , New Zealand ,\u201dThe Ship//The Sea\u201d is the 5th release from BEASTWARS [\u2026] Obstinacy: Sisyphean Dreams Unfolded Fleshvessel Right off the bat, you have to marvel at a composition like the four presented on this album. If nothing else, the band has vision. Twenty years ago, this kind of genre smashing didn\u2019t even exist, but now we hear more and more. The only thing I struggle with is finding enough people out there who might appreciate this varied plate of Extreme Metal. Then again, I know they are out there. The album is more like taking a trip somewhere you have never been and not packing anything with you\u2026you leave what happens from there up to a whim, or to fate, depending on what you believe. Your Inland Empire Your Inland Empire This album feels like a forgotten relic from the late \u201980s that has been carefully excavated, polished, and reimagined with modern sensibilities. Vocals drift between icy detachment and aching melancholy, perfectly suited to the genre\u2019s emotional palette. The songs carry that signature Darkwave introspection, but the Industrial edge gives them a bite that keeps the melancholic haze from ever feeling passive. Altogether, the album bridges synth-soaked memory and modern darkness. It\u2019s retro, it\u2019s current, it\u2019s immersive, and it hits harder than you expect. Unchained & Bloodstained Killer Hearts Hailing from Texas USA ,Killer Hearts are a leather clad electrifying rock n\u2019 roll band [\u2026] Sudden Impact Redshark What immediately becomes clear is that the band have opted to change their dimensions between Heavy Metal, Power Metal and Speed Metal by putting the emphasis on the latter of the three for \u201cSudden Impact\u201d. It makes this album just a tad more intense, slightly more in your face and certainly unable to ignore when you are listening to it. The Long Lasting Dusk Will O' Dusk I like what WILL O\u2019 DUSK are doing on \u201cThe Long Lasting Dusk\u201d. It\u2019s good, it\u2019s solid, it works, it fits. Bludgeoning Simulations Ghould Experimental, Post Metal, Industrial\u2026whatever you genre purists label this doesn\u2019t matter. The album is a barren wasteland\u2026a vast clearing of the trees in one of the northern most places on the earth. It\u2019s so cold, there are no animals\u2026nothing lives there\u2026nothing even grows there. It\u2019s like a void that if you dare to enter, you will join its dead. Providence Destruction Ritual Destruction Ritual knows how to fill time with intense, long blasts of black metal atmosphere... Amid Azketem This isn\u2019t your typical Black Metal album. Azekn infuses Gothic threads into the album, which is unusual, and his songwriting is not the common frigid aggression that you hear in the genre. The album is nuance, and even melodic at times, in a dark sort of way. Forget what you think you know about Black Metal and step into his world for a gem you won\u2019t often find. Malum in Se Funeral Harvest This was a haunting album that you could easily relive as a recurring nightmare, and once you open the door and invite it in, it will never leave until you are dead. The Hypercosmic Paradox Chaos Over Cosmos Few band possess this level of musicianship and skill, and even fewer are able to breathe life into heavily technical compositions. Rather than relying on the riff and the vocals to do most of the talking, the band uses electronics, synth, and ambiance to augment the songs. The result is an album that is as dexterous as it is an absolute joy to listen to. Embalming Heteropsy This 45 minute album felt like a slow and mournful couple years. A Thousand And One Nightmares Unrecht One thing becomes clear from the beginning, and stay that way all through the album; the riffing by UNRECHT is sometimes very canny, very intricate, thoroughly convincing and mostly well done. The growling/grunting vocals on the album are really fit for purpose, and very complementary of the musical intentions of the band. Homebrewed Recordings Willfire WILLFIRE is a band from J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Uusimaa, which is in Finland. They play pure straight forward old fashioned Heavy Metal, and have done so since 1998. Past the Veil of the Observable Universe Teach Them To Weep Although at its core, it\u2019s Black Metal, the album is really a very eclectic and varied mix of sounds, and you need to go into the listen with an open mind. Some music just isn\u2019t linear, and this out of the box album doesn\u2019t follow any rules. I found Sean\u2019s compositions to be intriguing and unorthodox, and anyone looking to explore will find some real gems here. Come On Everybody, Let\u2019s Do Nothing! IAN Post Rock sports one of the widest boundaries in music, and this fits into place. The screamed vocals are usually associated with Post Hardcore music, but there is more experimentation here then what you get out of the later. The most telling part about the depth of their sound is that sometimes the music is hard to make sense out of, and each listener could have an entirely different experience. Wayhome Kauan This was one of the few albums where the themes melded into the music so very well. For me, it\u2019s a story of perseverance, set to music that is poignant, expressive, and, at times, dramatic. There are so many things to discover about the album if you have the time, and it will charm you into immersing yourself in its secrets. PF Radio 2 PeelingFlesh Simply hilarious - Slam metal has never been more mainstream. Metempsychosis Bliss of Flesh Blackened death? Deathened black? Whatever it is, it rocks. Rise Of Independence Warfield Within \u201cRise Of Independence\u201d is a smart mixture of Death and Thrash Metal delivered with direct and punishing guitar riffs, double-bass attacks, and aggressive growling vocals Knochenges\u00e4nge II Waldgefl\u00fcster Although this is a Black Metal band, consider that term quite loosely when listening to the album, especially considering the recent bending of these once rigid genre rules. What you won\u2019t find is screaming, thick, aggressive guitars, and blast beat drums. What you will find are emotional songs with depth, with meaning, and with distinction. There are a lot of mysteries buried within the album, and it was fun for me to try to unravel some of them while letting others remain. Struck A Nerve Struck A Nerve \u201cStruck A Nerve\u201d is finest traditional Thrash Metal without compromise. The guitar riffing is flesh-ripping, the basslines are crushing, and the vocals are very aggressive Necrodestiny Ripping Remains I was turned off by Ripping Remains' new album - and that was probably the exact reaction they wanted. Death Obvious Death Obvious \u201cDEATH OBVIOUS came out of nowhere to release a debut album that coalesces elements of [\u2026] Ossuary Scorching Tomb Old-School Death Metal that isn't old at all? Scorching Tomb recreate the sounds of the 90's with scary accuracy. Ice Age Desert Dune Aurora DUNE AURORA commits to heavier and bluesier with \"Ice Age Desert.\" Altitude Solar Sons The force is strong with this one. More results...

REVIEW: FAUN \u2013 Hex Pagan folk rockers Faun released new album Hex and it\u2019s pretty good!

REVIEW: I See Stars \u2013 The Wheel I See Stars finally released their new album The Wheel, which is absolutely fantastic. REVIEW: Blessthefall \u2013 Gallows It\u2019s been seven long years since a Blessthefall album and new record Gallows has definitely been worth the wait. REVIEW: LASTELLE \u2013 Exist Vol.II Find out what Vicki thought of LASTELLE\u2019s new record Exist Vol II! Pierce the Veil + Guests @ Co-Op Live! (Review) Vicki went to see Pierce the Veil, with openers Crawlers, Hot Mulligan and Cavetown! REVIEW: Pinkshift \u2013 Earthkeeper Vicki had a listen to Pinkshift\u2019s new album Earthkeeper! REVIEW: Otherwise \u2013 Some Kind of Alchemy Lizi had a listen to Otherwise\u2019s hard rock EP Some Kind of Alchemy! REVIEW: Fit For a King \u2013 Lonely God Fit For a King coming up on almost 20 years as a band and honestly, it\u2019s impressive how consistent they\u2019ve remained throughout their career. Everyone has their favourite records of course; but FFAK\u2019s discography is one that I\u2019ve majorly only heard praise for and considering they\u2019re coming up on their 8th full-length album; that isn\u2019t something you find in a whole lot of bands. They have continuously tweaked and polished their sound without straying too far from their strengths and this remains the case for their upcoming LP Lonely God. The record contains everything their fans would want out of a FFAK project and more, finding the band not only in a stride but with the addition of some new flavours as well. REVIEW: Fox Lake \u2013 New World Heat Fox Lake have made quite the name for themselves over the last few years. Coming out of Denver in 2017, Fox Lake have established a chaos of sound that blurs the lines between metalcore, hardcore, hip-hop and nu-metal. Back in 2023 is when I personally came across the band with the explosive Fear and Loathing EP which not only became one of my favourite releases that year, but it also made its waves across the metalcore and hardcore communities relentlessly. Now, two years later the band have signed with MNRK Heavy and have released sophomore album New World Heat. LIVE REVIEW: Will Smith and support live in Cardiff! Will Smith closed out Depot Live\u2019s 2025 summer series at Cardiff Castle with support from Nile Rodgers and Chic and Rickie and Melvin! REVIEW: Halestorm \u2013 Everest Last week,\u00a0Halestorm\u00a0returned\u00a0with the release of their brand new album\u00a0Everest. A perfect blend of power ballads and classic rock anthems from modern icons,\u00a0Everest\u00a0is a twelve-track masterpiece and one of the best releases of the year so far. The main couple of themes I\u2019ve found is resilience, and being true to yourself. Everest\u00a0portrays this through the story-telling [\u2026] REVIEW: Storm \u2013 Join the Storm Lizi had a listen to teen star Storm\u2019s thrilling debut album Join the Storm! REVIEW: Hemelbestormer \u2013 The Radiant Veil Lizi had a listen to Hemelbestormer\u2019s The Radiant Veil.

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

Grand Theft Auto V Nov 18, 2014 \u2022 Rated M The sprawling sun-soaked metropolis of Los Santos is chock full of self-help coaches, starlets and C-List celebrities, once on top of the media world, now struggling to stay relevant in time of economic malaise and lowest-common-denominator reality TV.

NFL 2K1 Sep 7, 2000 \u2022 Rated E In the end, NFL 2K1 is a deeper, more refined version of the original game. 97 Metascore 16. Half-Life 2 Nov 16, 2004 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2004 PC Game of the Year]  By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- are counting on him. [Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience. After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture, a city hidden beneath the sea.

Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them? [2K Games] 96 Metascore 18.

The last time we heard from this post/prog group from Reading, UK was back in 2017. In his review of their debut album, Efference , El Cuervo asserted that Asira was on the cusp of being the next Big Deal. Just four months later, he decided that they already were, invoking Contrite Metal Guy powers to amend Efference \u00e2\u0080\u0099s score from 3.5 to 4.5 (a Big Deal, indeed!). Perhaps Asira felt some pressure, because they took their time to craft the best possible follow-up.\u201d Painterly blackness.

Christiano Filippini\u2019s Flames of Heaven \u2013 Symphony of the Universe Review By Twelve on November 17, 2025 in Reviews , Power Metal , Symphonic Metal , 14 comments \u201cChoosing new music to review is an interesting process. Once you pick a thing, you\u2019re pretty much locked into it. So I try to forecast: what will I be okay with listening to over and over again for the next week or two? Having just reviewed Lykke, I was very much in the mood for something more upbeat, and I didn\u2019t have to read far past the band name Christiano Filippini\u2019s Flames of Heaven to know Symphony of the Universe fit the bill. Indeed, when I requested the files for review, Dolphin Whisperer , overheard the request. \u201cIs that Italian power metal?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt sounds like Italian power metal.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t check,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut yes.\u201d We were right.\u201d Most don\u2019t expect the Italian inquisition. Terror Corpse \u2013 Ash Eclipses Flesh Review By Saunders on November 17, 2025 in Reviews , Death Metal , 15 comments \u201cAlready boasting a killer debut EP to their name in 2025, courtesy of the sick, old school deathgrind mayhem comprising Systems of Apocalypse , Texan wrecking crew Terror Corpse hit the ground running in their short time together. The newly minted outfit come seasoned with underground cred, featuring members that have logged time in the likes of Malignant Altar , Oceans of Slumber , Necrofier and Insect Warfare . Recording the EP as a five-piece, debut full-length Ash Eclipses Flesh finds Terror Corpse stripping back to a trio and shifting tact musically\u201d Death walking Texas Rangers. Mezzrow \u2013 Embrace the Awakening Review By Dr. A.N. Grier on November 17, 2025 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 27 comments \u201cWith age and wisdom, it appears this quintet is looking to make an impact decades after the heydays of this unique flavor of thrash came and went. The energy, since the release of Summon Thy Demons , must continue to surge in their veins because I\u2019m back to deliver a review of this year\u2019s Embrace the Awakening . While none of their albums are terrible by any means, will the \u2018third-times-the-charm\u2019 bring Mezzrow the breakout success they seek?\u201d Makin\u2019 a Mezz. Cold Steel \u2013 Discipline & Punish Review By Lavender Larcenist on November 16, 2025 in Reviews , Hardcore , 62 comments \u201cDebut albums are a fickle thing. Often the strongest release by a band for years to come, even giving rise to the term \u201csophomore slump\u201d when the inevitable follow-up can\u2019t hit the same highs. And so, debuts are make-or-break. For Tampa\u2019s Cold Steel , Discipline & Punish is such a piping hot serving of crossover thrash, I can\u2019t help but be excited for their future.\u201d Steel is best served cold. Vandampire \u2013 Hope Scars Review By Spicie Forrest on November 15, 2025 in Reviews , Post-Metal , Sludge Metal , 21 comments \u201cPost- historically implies an evolution of or successor to a previous idea (modernism, rock, structuralism, punk, hardcore, colonialism, etc.). While a little nebulous, post-metal more or less riffs on the post-rock blueprint. It utilizes metal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intense, abrasive instrumentation to create an emotional vulnerability that even the best power ballads fail to capture. There is a tenderness in its crushing weight, a sense of freedom and catharsis in its restraint. It is this corner of the metalverse that South West England-based Vandampire inhabits.\u201d Post-hope. Tempestuous Fall \u2013 The Descent of Mortals Past Review By ClarkKent on November 14, 2025 in Reviews , Funeral Doom , Symphonic Metal , 15 comments \u201cIn 2012, Australia\u2019s Dis Pater released the debut record for his third active\u00e2\u0080\u0094at the time\u00e2\u0080\u0094one-man project: The Stars Would Not Awaken You by Tempestuous Fall , a work of epic funeral doom. The following year, Pater released what might be the strangest split I\u2019ve heard of: a three-way between his own active projects. It ended up being a \u201c[three] men enter, one man leaves\u201d kind of deal, with Midnight Odyssey being the lone survivor. In that time, he has contributed to several other bands, from a Greek black metal group, Kawir , to a Slovakian black metal group, Aeon Winds , as well as a whopping nine LPs for Midnight Odyssey . Yet something about the funeral doom of Tempestuous Fall must have called Pater back. Backed by classical symphonic elements, it turns out he had rather ambitious goals for sophomore album, The Descent of Mortals Past .\u201d Fall of mortal hearts. Degraved \u2013 Spectral Realm of Ruin Review By Steel Druhm on November 14, 2025 in Reviews , Death Metal , 13 comments \u201cSeattle-based old school deathers Degraved have been lurking in the back alleys since 2020, tweaking their rancid and rotten caveman-trapped-in-a-cesspool sound for maximum stench terror.  2025 sees them finally give birth to their debut full-length, Spectral Realm of Ruin , and let\u2019s just say their offspring ain\u2019t a looker. Sounding like a time-locked study into the effects of early 90s death on the human brain, you get a nauseating fusion of early Cianide , Incantation , Autopsy , and disEMBOWELMENT .  This is low-grade, scuzzy, and exceptionally fetid skunk cabbage suitable only for the worst of us.\u201d Altars of Asparagus. Citadel \u2013 Descension [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Kenstrosity on November 14, 2025 in Reviews , Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Blackened Death Metal , Death Metal , Melodic Death Metal , Progressive Metal , 78 comments \u201c2025 has been a banner year for the long form in my book. With such high-ranking triumphs from T\u00c3\u00b3mar\u00c3\u00bam , An Abstract Illusion , and Flummox in rotation, you\u2019d think there wouldn\u2019t be any time left for another. Yet, New Jersey trio Citadel dropped the lush and dramatic Descension upon the Earth back in late March, and it\u2019s never left my rotation since.\u201d Fortress of goodness.

An Slua Sure Look It LP It\u2019s time to face an uncomfortable truth\u2014a lot of modern Oi! is complete and utter shite. It\u2019s either hardcore lite made by people in big shorts, or it\u2019s pop punk about the pub made by people in flat caps they bought off Amazon. It\u2019s bland, overproduced, insipid bollocks . So when I get the chance to listen to something truly good, not just \u201cgenre good\u201d but actually good, it\u2019s a real treat. AN SLUA is that treat. The Sligo skins have released a modern classic in their debut. Joining luminaries like OI POLLOI and the OPPRESSED in being fiercely political and not being afraid to nail their (correct) colours to the mast at a time when cowards are happy to be fencesitters, they also know their way around a tune. Catchy as fuck, lyrically whip-smart, and choruses that beg to be shouted on the terraces. This is, quite simply, class. Any time you don\u2019t bother listening to this is time wasted. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Distroy / Longshot Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bad to Worse These Are Our Streets cassette One of those bands that isn\u2019t really sure what they want to sound like. Swapping between an amalgamation of HOT WATER MUSIC, O PIONEERS!, CRO-MAGS, and CHOKING VICTIM, the only consistent variable is the vocalist who maintains the same dynamic throughout the entire record. While the stamina is impressive, the lack of vocal nuance is a tad dry. The gang vocals laden throughout sound great and pepper in a much needed charisma boost. A release where everyone involved is obviously quite talented, but it all sounds a bit dated. The whole orgcore motif combining the posi-tough-guy image with the sentimental longing for \u201chome\u201d was fresh fifteen years ago but still hasn\u2019t hit its nostalgia period, it just sounds stale. However, if you still pine for that era, then you\u2019ll love this. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Beta Maximo \u00daltimo Asalto cassette As is more often than not the case, Knuckles on Stun brings us yet another absolute smash hit! BETA MAXIMO is a wildly prolific garage punk band from Spain with more releases than some bands have songs. Eight catchy and driving tracks, most of which are pushed over the top by having almost sickeningly poppy synth licks. I absolutely love this! I truly hope that my Spanish not being very good might mean there is a chance that \u00daltimo Asalto is not the band\u2019s way of telling us that this is their final release. If that is the case, then I really hope I am of the lucky 25 people to get a copy of the forthcoming BETA MAXIMO discography cassette on Knuckles on Stun, as that is the standard amount that label makes of each of their releases (this one included), so get one while you can. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bezette Stad F.A.N.O.N. 12\u2033 Belgian hardcore band BEZETTE STAD has been releasing music for about five years now. Their latest release F.A.N.O.N. is a six-song 12\u2033 that explores our contemporary global scenario with articulate hardcore blended with D-beat, as if PAINT IT BLACK started hanging out with DISCHARGE. From the bass-heavy opener of \u201cReform\u201d to the metallic pummeling and digital glitching in closer \u201c28 Days\u201d the F.A.N.O.N. 12\u2033 is six slices of hardcore hellion heaven, and you need to put it in your ear holes posthaste. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Shield Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Celebration Summer / Wolf-Face DCxPC Live, Volume 42 split LP Recorded live at The Fest, DCxPC Live, Volume 42 pairs CELEBRATION SUMMER from DC. with Florida\u2019s WOLF-FACE for two distinct takes on melodic punk energy. CELEBRATION SUMMER lean into earnest, \u201990s-style melodic punk showing their JAWBREAKER and TILTWHEEL influences. WOLF-FACE counters with a more playful set that mixes their Teen Wolf basketball-punk personas with solid, tuneful, orgcore-flavored \u201c whoaaaaa \u201d sing-alongs, including a cover of TV ON THE RADIO\u2019s \u201cWolf Like Me\u201d and a live version of \u201cI Wanna Be a Homo(sapien)\u201d with a hirsute wink toward SCREECHING WEASEL. The recording quality is rough, but it feels like an honest snapshot of two bands connecting with a crowd. Limited to 200 copies on this yellowish color that someone decided to call \u201csummer moon.\u201d Reviewer Jeff Cost Label DCxPC Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Cell Rot Parasite LP This Bay Area grindcore outfit mixes with sludge and powerviolence in a recipe for chaos at its most unrelenting. CELL ROT\u2019s Parasite is a slab of total aggression\u2014eleven tracks that sound like they were recorded inside a pressure cooker. The production is dense but not dull; each blastbeat and low-end rumble slices through with terrifying precision. Vocals are guttural, halfway between a scream and a cave echo, backed by riffs that refuse to stay in one tempo for more than two seconds. There\u2019s a sharp political and existential edge here\u2014nihilism meets confrontation. Convulse keeps releasing records that make the underground feel dangerous again. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Convulse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Christopher Alan Durham Basement Debris 2021\u20132025 cassette Well, there\u2019s a confusing one in every batch. This C.A.D. cassette, which doesn\u2019t have the full name of the artist on it anywhere (and the top of the \u201cC\u201d on the front cover is cut off to the point that I would have sworn it said LAD), is a solo acoustic cassette of four-track songs recorded by CHRISTOPHER ALAN DURHAM. He is a member of a full band out of Detroit, Michigan under the name C.A.D. AND THE PEACETIME CONSUMERS, which is more throwback, freak-out rock\u2019n\u2019roll stuff. This tape, however, I just kind of can\u2019t understand. Super lo-fi, jangly guitar, jazzy, jammy art. There\u2019s drums on at least one of the songs which kept my interest a little more, but the acoustic stuff just feels like a budget bastard amalgamation of REED, DYLAN, and BEEFHEART, and I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret\u2026it doesn\u2019t mix well. The final track, \u201cWalk in the Park,\u201d certainly did not live up to its name\u2014what an absolute slog to get through, clocking in at over four minutes and confusing me the entire time. It did receive a little baffled interest from one of my cats though, looking around with complete bewilderment whenever the sampled bird whistles were peppered in. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label All Gone Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Enyor Catalunya En Blanc i Negre LP Catalan Oi! that tosses an interesting curveball. Of all the stylistic mashups, an indie rock twist was about the last thing I was expecting. Musically, this lands squarely in lo-fi Revolution Summer territory, but the vocals are pure boot boy fodder. I\u2019m convinced that with a different vocal delivery, this would fall into a vastly different genre altogether. Smash together RITES OF SPRING with the TEMPLARS, if you can imagine such an amalgamation. Nine tracks, with a NEGATIVE APPROACH cover for good measure. A\u00a0 pioneering attempt to be sure, but the incongruity is hard to get past. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Fan Club Stimulation EP Formerly known as LYSOL, Seattle\u2019s FAN CLUB hits a new high on Stimulation , a five-song, six-minute blast of incendiary hardcore punk with a rock\u2019n\u2019roll undercurrent. The songs tear forward with relentless motion and sharp, swaggering energy\u2014closer to SEUDO YOUTH in pace and delivery than the slower grind of a lot of their earlier material. It recalls \u201cBlessures Graves,\u201d the standout from LYSOL\u2019s Soup for My Family , where they ditched mid-tempo for full-throttle attack but somehow held on to the strut. It\u2019s a sound that feels urgent, alive, and fully realized. One of the best things I heard all summer, and I swear this band keeps getting better the faster they move. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Feel It Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Fretbuzz Nothing is Just Nothing / It\u2019s So Hard 7\u2033 My comparisons will draw some very solid lines as to whether you want to grab this: stir in some modern MOVING TARGETS + FEELIES + GIN BLOSSOMS + later 2024-era SOUL ASYLUM, pleasant-sounding indie rock, and you get the picture. These FRETBUZZ songs hover in a cloudy space where if they actually had some fret buzzing going on, or pushed a little harder in any direction, it would stand out more. Look, at the end of the day, this is a great single that hits on power pop in the \u201990s Midwestern style and has all the right points of a good record. The flipside \u201cIt\u2019s So Hard\u201d is a bit more driving, but still not speeding through any school zones. Reviewer Tony Party Label Target Earth Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Grimly Pleased I\u2019ll Choose It EP This is short, to-the-point, and excellent. Bouncy cowpunk that inevitably brings to mind stuff like THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS and maybe the spirit of Hitler Bad -era VANDALS (in a good way!). Consistency is impressive for these guys, they continue to deliver bouncy-to-the-point-of-dance-y jams with clever, even poignant lyrics. Music like this rewards multiple listens if you click with it, though I imagine the overall sunny disposition may put some people off. Not me though, this world is a fucking nightmare and spending eight punk, fun minutes with some clever music is decidedly on the menu. Reviewer Daniel Z. Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Hellshock XXV 12\u2033 It seems not so long ago since HELLSHOCK\u2019s 2022 LP came out, a record I could not quite totally get into, I must admit, because it relied too much on classic death metal and it basically lost me\u2014of course, it was certainly more than good enough when in the mood for mean, BOLT THROWER-flavoured music. The fantasy-themed cover of this new LP looks like a scene from The Lord of the Rings and is (I can barely write it) in colour, undeniably a blasphemous cardinal scene in the crust realm. I was more than a little skeptical before playing this, and how wrong I was. The lugubrious BOLT THROWER worship still rules, but the recruitment of Todd Burdette on second guitar brings a significantly different vibe to the songwriting, making it more epic, murkier, but still generating that ominous atmospheric heaviness. The songs are rather long, thoughtfully built, and tell great, albeit really fucking dark, stories. HELLSHOCK are still certainly themselves, and the album will not disappoint fans of gruff metal crust and stenchcore revivalists, but they also offer something more articulate, progressive even, and dare I say it, subtle here (assuming the perfect soundtrack for a malevolent skeleton armies and being growled at by a zombified bear fit the concept of subtlety). The LP has been on heavy rotation here, and I see it as the perfect evolution for the band. XXV is bound to become a classic crust album, not because it abides by the rulebook, but because it creates something new and inventive without discarding the band\u2019s identity. They do not sound alike, but I see records like COUNTERBLAST\u2019s Balance of Pain or SKAVEN\u2019s EP in much the same way. You know what to do. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Agipunk / Black Water Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Love Story in Blood Red Everything\u2019s Everywhere LP Presumably compiling their entire oeuvre, the ever-reliable Good Times Rock N Roll Club out of New York has provided us with the works of a mid-2000s gem of a project entitled LOVE STORY IN BLOOD RED. With 27 tracks in all, there is more than plenty to digest here. For fans of the vocal stylings of JONATHAN RICHMAN, this collection comes highly recommended. The main brainchild here, Jason Frederick, along with a handful of bandmates over the lifetime of the project, has a real knack for attention-grabbing lyrics and instrumentation. The band/project seemed to exist for only about four years in the Chicagoland area, and while I can\u2019t speak to their influence or impact at the time, getting the chance to dig into these songs twenty years later is a real treat. Surely meant to be digested over time, these dozens of tracks feel like an awesome time capsule that is worth the time to take in in its entirety, even if that takes several listens. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Good Times Rock N Roll Club Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Mecht Mensch Anthology LP Absolutely legendary early \u201880s Wisconsin hardcore. The \u201cMechanical Men\u201d tore through the dairyland with mechanical precision when they dropped one holy grail of Midwest punk, the Acceptance EP, in 1983, a furious little record that nailed paranoia, politics, and pure punk anger to the classics wall. They didn\u2019t stick around long, but their sound seeped into the underground. No Coast resurrected MECHT MENSCH\u2019s entire recorded catalog with Anthology , pulling together the aforementioned Acceptance EP, compilation tracks, demos, and live recordings, all remastered from the original reels, even sourced from Henry Rollins\u2019s archive. To complete the deluxe treatment, there is a gatefold sleeve, full-size zine packed with flyers and interviews, plus a huge poster. More than a nostalgia piece, it is a hardcore time capsule. A loud reminder that hardcore will never die. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label No Coast Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Personal Hell Window Painted Shut LP Lumbering and nasty hardcore from West Yorkshire\u2019s PERSONAL HELL, who occasionally wade into neo-crust territory on their new LP Window Painted Shut . It sounds like the band spared no expense on the production of this album: the guitars are thick and crunchy, the rhythm section is low and burly, and the vocals are desperate and right at the front of the mix. There isn\u2019t a bad song in the bunch, but I prefer the quicker cuts, like the excellent \u201cThe Brine.\u201d Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Natural Sciences Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Petty Crime Brighton, UK, 1999 EP A year after putting out one of the best 7\u201ds of the \u201990s (1998\u2019s Forfeit Intent EP) on one of the greatest labels of the \u201990s (Slampt Underground Organisation forever), Helen White and Layla Gibbon of PETTY CRIME took their short, sharp girl-gang post-punk missives to the domestic interior space of a literal bedroom, recording three new tracks to cassette that remained unheard until now. Intimate, immediate, and with a joyously shambolic recklessness, Brighton, UK, 1999 is not unlike eavesdropping on conspiratorial plots being devised from the other side of a paper-thin wall\u2014when Helen and Layla sing and shout about truth and detachment and misplaced trust, it\u2019s always with an underlying sense of danger. Taut bass weaves around sparse scratches of guitar, desperate rhythms are pounded out on household objects functioning as makeshift drums, and the ultra-lo-fi presentation of it all truly underscores the feeling of stumbling on a radical secret straight from the organizing committee of the boy/girl revolution. A life-affirming document! Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Jabs / Raw Sugar Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ruby Rash Merit Badges cassette Heavy goth and deathrock-inflected synth punk with fuzzy low-end crunch, pounding electronic drums, and melodic, melancholic vocals. Tempos range from creepy crawlers like the gorgeous shoegaze-y alternate reality club hit \u201cDream Eater\u201d to the faster punk beat of \u201cBroken Moon,\u201d but all maintain the same morose power. Recommended for fans of bands like HORROR VACUI and PINKISH BLACK, RUBY RASH creates dark, subwoofer-rattling atmospheres perfect for those of us who enjoy spooky season year-round. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Skeleton City Souvenirs Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Sinkhole Groping for Trout LP Vinyl re-release for the originally CD-only debut album by this \u201990s pop punk standout. I have a pretty positive memory of this band from that era; they seemed more invested in songcraft than a lot of their contemporaries, and listening to it now that rings even more true. There\u2019s just more going on musically even when the goal is catchy, melodic punk rock. The recording has a new mastering job that elevates the different components, putting the guitars and melodious vocals right in your\u00a0 face. I will say, the band always lacked a little bit of bite for my taste and that still holds true now, but not to the massive detriment of the record. Somewhere between WESTON and SQUIRTGUN with a dash of GAMEFACE, this is very, very \u201990s. It sounds a lot better than it did in \u201994 and has a couple comp/single bonus tracks too, a fine release overall. Reviewer Daniel Z. Label Dead Broke Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Sklitakling Normal Drift LP Loved these guys! Their layering really made the songs feel super whole and created this tense, thick atmosphere. I loved the bass lines and cascading vocals, which were both screamy and melodic at the same time. If you like anything punk, check these guys out. Reviewer Emma Miller Label Back to Beat Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Star 99 Gaman LP \u201cKill,\u201d the first song, is terrific, with melody, clarity, and drive. I love songs that can pin a time of year outside of basic imagery associated with color, touch, smell. When Saoirse sings about cicadas, it collapses on time of year with sight, smell, and sound with one word; she has delivered a near-perfect line. However, after this song the LP starts some twists and turns that flow into dream pop, indie rock, and things like that. There are two distinct songwriters, and their styles vary in a way that makes me wish this were a split LP with two different bands. Both styles are similar but different enough to make the Gaman LP not flow. Also, I personally get a bit bored with broken-hearted boys with troubles, and half of this LP is that. I\u2019d say this is for folks that like the MEASURE, P.S. ELIOT, RADIATOR HOSPITAL, the AMBULARS, and such. Reviewer Tony Party Label Lauren Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Static\u00f8 Absurdity of This World LP With a creative flavor of hardcore out of Serbia, this first full-length from STATIC\u00d8 mixes influences to create a unique cohesion. Infused with relentless Scandi-punk pummeling, it pushes the spirit of UK82 to aggravated extremes, creating a fitting backdrop for their intensely passionate social and political commentary. This union is surprisingly natural, demonstrating the unspoken handshake that exists between the styles while creating a futuristic feel that rings maybe loudest in the chaotic title track. When the closing \u201cThe End\u201d comes on, echoing the morbid march of SIEGE\u2019s \u201cGrim Reaper,\u201d it\u2019s hard to imagine a cooler conclusion. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Ayran Sounds / Onesna\u017eevanje Uma / Out of the Darkness / Refuse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Top Dollar Objects of Misfortune EP Get ready for the TOP DOLLAR stomp! Objects of Misfortune is an eight-track beast of an EP from New York\u2019s TOP DOLLAR released on 11PM Records, the go-to label for all the best \u201cmodern\u201d hardcore releases. Two years after their excellent demo, TOP DOLLAR unleashes their New York youth-crew-styled hardcore played at maximum velocity, with an unpredictable edge \u00e0 la Youth Attack Records. All bangers, no fillers, with impeccable energy throughout, this is a record that will be spinning on my turntable for a long time. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label 11 PM Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 A\u0155esi Aurrera Beti 12\u2033 I\u2019ll be the first to admit that my knowledge of the Basque language leaves much to be desired, which is an enormous shame since Mendeku Diskak has been instrumental in spotlighting what continues to be a verdant and fertile scene of top-notch punk. A\u0154ESI is no different, having already impressed with a few potted releases, and now a full(er)-length 12\u201d. A potent mix of rock\u2019n\u2019Oi! which has a nod to BLITZ and some of the more rockin\u2019 CROWN COURT tunes to boot(boy). It really is impressive to write such compelling sing-alongs in a language I can\u2019t speak, let alone shout along to. And yet I do. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bard\u00f8 Self Sabotage cassette Described as \u201cold fuckers on a PV bent,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what it is. Very raw-sounding, unpretentious powerviolence with obligatory intro samples. INFEST and NEANDERTHAL are high on their influences list, as they take some of their cues and use them to perfection. Old school to the core. What else to say? Let\u2019s fucking go! Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Rip Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Burgers Gone Wild / Dru the Drifter Do the Shplit! split cassette Following in the lineage of Jay Reatard and Drew Owen, DRU THE DRIFTER is a prolific young purveyor of lo-fi garagery, and the A-side of this tape showcases four new transmissions from this the incorrigible punk upstart. On the flip, BURGERS GONE WILD is a tambourine-shakin\u2019 one-man force to be reckoned with in the spirit of King Louie Bankston (R.I.P.) If you like it cheap and cheeky, you\u2019ll be rocking this one until you need a pencil to help spin its guts back inside. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Candy Snatchers Good Riddance / Round Up 7\u2033 Two new tracks of pure, unadulterated rock\u2019n\u2019roll from Virginia Beach\u2019s own CANDY SNATCHERS, now entering their thirty-third year of existence. What\u2019s left to say about a band that\u2019s been consistently active for the last three decades? Vocalist Larry May sounds like a combination of MEAT LOAF and Lux Interior of CRAMPS fame. May\u2019s range and energy is equal parts impressive and inspirational. Some folks begin phoning it all in after a measly ten years, but Larry\u2019s still out there spitting venom\u2014full of piss, vinegar, and Mountain Dew. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t talk about the music itself. This slab sounds fantastic; beautiful production and tight as hell. I\u2019m a tad shocked at how much I love this little piece of wax. Proof that punk can get better with age. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label I-94 Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Class Act Malaise LP CLASS ACT from Kansas City follows their debut tape with Malaise , a grimy and offbeat LP that toggles from full-speed West Coast-style hardcore punk to lumbering mid-tempo noise rock. There\u2019s offbeat, angular guitar work, some instrumental interludes, and vocals that gleefully rant and rave throughout. It\u2019s a frantic and at times chaotic listen; fans of MINUTEMEN and SACCHARINE TRUST will find lots to love here. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Under the Gun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Dissidents / D.O.V.E. A Better World split LP Now I didn\u2019t see this one coming, but it is a record that makes a lot of sense, not just musically but politically as well. Unless you have been living in total isolation in a cave for the past ten years, living off insects, dead snails, and moss, you will have noticed that the world is getting more oppressive, violent, and intolerant by the hour, and it is only logical that some punk bands, as a form of protest, use the medium to express their outrage in a way that is relevant to the present sociopolitical context. A Better World is a record embedded in our contemporary reality; it is a punk record of the old anarcho-punk tradition, a collaboration between two like-minded bands, united by a common message: the DISSIDENTS from Philadelphia (with the much-respected Bill Chamberlain on guitar, who tragically passed recently), and D.O.V.E. from California. I love the album a lot for its sincerity, its positive energy. and for the effort from both bands to write catchy tunes that have proved to be perfectly hummable. The DISSIDENTS, with their dual female vocals and dynamic, tuneful punk rock style, remind me of \u201890s and \u201800s bands like HARUM-SCARUM, the ASSASSINATORS, or even UK bands like DAN. The band manages to be melodic and angry at the same time in an old school fashion. I liked their split with VITRIOLIC RESPONSE, and this one is even better. On the other side, D.O.V.E. goes for a more classic \u201980s anarcho-punk sound (often renamed \u201cpeace punk\u201d in the context of the \u201980s and \u201990s punk scene in Southern California), a genre I have always cherished dearly. Their first LP was very good but showed that D.O.V.E. was still learning how to fly. This new effort is more focused, the songwriting is more solid, diverse, and memorable, and demonstrates how great the band has become. At their most upbeat, classic UK bands like the SEARS or A-HEADS come to mind, but there is also a moodier post-punk vibe running through the music, and INDIAN DREAM, AWAKE MANKIND, and LOST CHERREES also got invites, while the band even dares to wander into proper OMEGA TRIBE-approved hippie-punk territory with the soft \u201cPeace by Piece.\u201d If you don\u2019t like classic anarcho-punk, D.O.V.E.\u2019s music won\u2019t really cut it (hopefully the message will), but I love the genre, and they gracefully tick all the boxes of genuine idealist anarcho-punk music\u2014in a world full of bitterness and cynicism, this record feels fresh. You should definitely hurry. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Grow Your Own Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Em Gee NMA cassette I admire this project because it is unapologetically about being things that the punk world at large tends to scoff at these days: it\u2019s a hyper-personal, bedroom-pop-feeling, ukulele-forward bit of folk punk. It takes huge balls to put that combination out into the world, so I have to commend that courage. It comes close to working for me, but sadly it doesn\u2019t quite get there. It sounds like a lo-fi, back-alley performance (is \u201cback-alley punk\u201d a thing? it should be) version of the spirit of the WORLD INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY through a Plan-it X Records filter. There is a ton of charm here, confessional and simply direct lyrics that very much have a personality, and some beautiful little moments, but on most tracks, that slightly off-meter folk punk vocal delivery just doesn\u2019t come together with the song. The fact that there is a full band and some interesting instrumentation (there\u2019s a trombone in here) comes so fucking close to making it work, too. I didn\u2019t hate this, I can tell it\u2019s just not my thing more than any objective flaw in the music, but I\u2019m glad this is out there. Reviewer Daniel Z. Label Broken Sound Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Entrapped Sv\u011btlo Je Mrtv\u00fd LP Phobia Records never misses, and ENTRAPPED\u2019s Sv\u011btlo Je Mrtv\u00fd (\u201cThe Light is Dead\u201d) proves it once again. Dark, desperate crust punk from Czechia that crawls out from under the ashes of human collapse. Echoing vocals, grinding riffs, and mid-tempo drumming build an atmosphere that feels post-apocalyptic yet oddly triumphant. The record feels cinematic\u2014each track adds to a larger world of decay, but the energy never falters. Bleak, honest, and absolutely vital for the current state of European crust. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Phobia Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Frig\u00f6ra Fullst\u00e4ndig Frig\u00f6relse LP All punx rejoice, as General Speech continues doing the work to bring us the absolute goods! In this case, we get the complete studio discography of \u201990s Tokyo legends FRIG\u00d6RA, compiling 27 tracks of buzzsaw punk with a m\u00e4ngel bent. My theory is that they must have heard K\u00e4rnvapen Attack and dove all the way in. Tight, ferocious blasts that never outstay their welcome. Only one cut crosses the two-minute mark, and most don\u2019t come anywhere close. Damaging waves of distortion make for a tidal wave of destructive punk, all done up in a luscious package with a sweet booklet. This is a limited release that will undoubtedly get snatched up fast, so do yourself a solid and hop on it! Reviewer Matt Casteel Label General Speech Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Gentleman Jesse I Wonder if You Would Even Notice: Singles and Rarities LP This Atlanta four-piece plays upbeat, hook-driven power pop built on clean guitars and tight melodies. Sharing some of the same DNA as EXPLODING HEARTS or the TRANZMITORS but with a lighter, less aggressive touch, GENTLEMAN JESSE trades in most of the speed and harshness for classic pop songwriting. Formed in 2006 by Jesse Smith with drummer Dave Rahn (both from CARBONAS), the band\u2019s early singles captured a scene steeped in melody and a fascination with the late \u201970s band the NERVES. This collection gathers sixteen tracks from those first five years, most around two minutes long, offering a concise picture of their evolution. Later songs like \u201cI Want What\u2019s Mine\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Hardly Take It Anymore\u201d stand out for their extra bite and momentum, but damn if my brain doesn\u2019t keep going back to the first track, \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Know (Where You Been Tonight),\u201d which is just a really good pop song. The collection as a whole works as a snapshot of an era when a bunch of punks started playing pop music. The lyrics, true to style, stick pretty close to affairs of the heart. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Beach Impediment Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Gerber and the Babies Gerber and the Babies cassette GERBER AND THE BABIES capture the egg-punk/garage Midwest thing very well. At times, the vocals remind me of WALL OF VOODOO. Sometimes this style can go too far into synth or too far into scream-babble, but GERBER AND THE BABIES ride perfectly within the guardrails to make a really fine cassette of catchy and silly tunes. There are nine tracks, making this the perfect length of a listen. The only issue I have with this is that it is put together so well that it has all the elements of a one-time-band release, and then I\u2019ll have to start tracking down the members to see what they do next. Reviewer Tony Party Label Indolent Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 HISTAMINE Quality of Life LP Quality debut LP for this Australian band. Punk-centered, stompy-as-fuck hardcore that is drenched in the echoes of the vocals to an interesting/unique effect. The band also manages to sprinkle some metal leads and unexpected melodic moments throughout the duration to keep shit from getting boring. I\u2019m a big fan of this type of hardcore being produced largely and cleanly, and it does a killer job of filling out the sound here. Convulse is on roll of releasing HC punk in this vein recently, and they snagged a winner with HISTAMINE. Could have used a little more variety in the slim fifteen-ish-minute runtime, but that\u2019s a nitpick; solid hardcore is always welcome. Reviewer Daniel Z. Label Convulse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Kiratxa Giza Ustelkeria EP KIRATXA out of Spain plays blistering, noise-blasted punk that rips. The Giza Ustelkeria EP is seven songs that go harder than anything else you\u2019ve recently listened to. I promise. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Diy Kontraatak / Emprenadur / Heriotza Ta Suntsiketa / Lagunak / Victim / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Lookers Deeper LP Sounding like if PJ HARVEY smoothed out all her edges, LOOKERS offer up ten tracks of self-described \u201cdark pop\u201d that don\u2019t seem to firmly plant roots in the listener\u2019s brain. The words \u201cpleasant enough\u201d come to mind over and over as the album moves along, but these tracks feel like they want to feel more confrontational\u2014again, the sleekness unfortunately dampens the fervor. This isn\u2019t to say this album is a total drag, but it just feels like there is a discrepancy between what is trying to be conveyed and what the end result becomes. The vocals can be interesting when they go unexpectedly minor-key or intentionally flatter than you were expecting, which keeps the interest piqued a bit, but they can also do the opposite, like when certain words are just repeated too many times that don\u2019t really have any gravitas, which happens more than a few times throughout (including right from the jump with the words \u201cTV dinner\u201d repeated seemingly ad nauseum). Needed more raucousness, less innocuousness. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Almost Ready Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Mar-Mars Demo 2025 cassette Quirky lo-fi punk rock from Savannah, GA. Demo 2025 is the second full-length cassette from the MAR-MARS, and their first release featuring a full-band lineup. Their self-titled cassette was released as a solo project and has something of a dark, broody street punk aspect to it. This new MAR-MARS release has versions of five songs off the first cassette, so it\u2019s easy to listen back and forth to the progression of the project. A solo project turning into a full band can bring a new excitement to what was once only able to be a recording project. Unfortunately, in the case of the MAR-MARS, the main things that seem to have changed are that the recording of this new cassette is considerably more lo-fi, and the songs sound as if they are holding on for dear life to keep from falling apart at the seams. I was surprised to see that there was a label associated with the release of this, presumably run by someone from the band, as their other release is also on it, but nowhere on the cassette or shell can that information be found. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Split Ends Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ofensa \u00bfCual Humanidad? cassette Genre-bending metal punk from Barcelona, with one foot on the classic UK crust sound and another in the cold buzzsaw death and black metal from Scandinavia. The crusty NIHILIST tone gives the guitars a new dimension of heaviness, and the very politically-minded vocals still make this a very punk-oriented record. OFENSA almost fits the neocrust label, reminding me of bands like AMBULANCE or EKKAIA, but somehow they are something else. A bleak piece of music for bleak times. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label A World Divided Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Pena Maxima Alentando Hasta El Fin LP Spanish-sung Oi! from Miami, Florida, with lots of gang vocals, gruff football chants, and anthemic guitar leads. PENA MAXIMA has been around since 2016 and is just now releasing their debut, which is evident in the polished production, skillful playing, and tight songwriting. It isn\u2019t really my taste, but I can appreciate the talent on display here, and can certainly see the appeal for the Samba-wearing crowd. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Street Rats Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ripcord The Damage is Done LP For those living under a rock, RIPCORD was a seminal hardcore punk band from the seaside town of Weston\u2011super\u2011Mare, England, active from 1984 to 1988. These lads played extremely fast hardcore punk with elements that positioned them among the first UK bands to push toward grindcore territory. Their music combined the speed and aggression of US hardcore with the rawness of UK82 punk, having been cited as one of the flagship bands of the UK\u2019s mid\u2011\u201980s hardcore scene alongside bands such as HERESY (for whom RIPCORD\u2019s founder Steve \u201cBaz\u201d Ballam played) and NAPALM DEATH. RIPCORD\u2019s The Damage is Don e was first released in 1986, originally as a flexi. From the start, The Damage Is Done doesn\u2019t waste any time; each track barrels forward, maintaining a relentless intensity throughout its runtime. One of the standout features of this album is the band\u2019s ability to balance chaos with structure. While the songs are undoubtedly fast and abrasive, there\u2019s a clear sense of purpose in the way they build tension and release it. Lyrically, they don\u2019t shy away from heavy topics: anti-authoritarianism, personal frustration, and critiques of societal hypocrisy. The production is appropriately raw, giving the album a live-wire energy that enhances its punch to the gut. It\u2019s not polished to the point of losing any of the rough edges that make hardcore so captivating, but it\u2019s clean enough to make every instrument shine through, even in the most chaotic moments. Overall, RIPCORD proves 39 years later that they captured the essence of punk in a way that feels timeless and entirely of this present moment. Free Ola! Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label La Vida Es Un Mus / Quality Control HQ Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Sakura Violencia flexi EP The three-song Violencia flexi was created by four-piece Las Vegas band SAKURA, and it fucking rips! Drawing heavily upon the extensive sound catalog of Japanese hardcore, SAKURA melds noisy, terminal velocity punk into songs that immediately call to mind other things that rip, like RESIN\u2019s 2021 Pot Overdose or DEAD CITY\u2019s 2022 Banned from L.A. What I\u2019m saying is that if you\u2019re into that punk crudo that makes your inner ear feel like a kick drum, or when feedback sounds like an M-80 in a bowl of Rice Krispies, then you\u2019re going to want to pick this one up. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Discos Enfermos Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Snarewaves DIY flexi EP Four quick jammers on this release that equals about two minutes of music total. It\u2019s fun and raucous: LUMPY AND THE DUMPERS-style gross-out vocals, reverbed garage punk guitars, and digital drums, all played very fast. There isn\u2019t much information online about SNAREWAVES, but they have quite a few of these micro punk capsules and a lot of colorful artwork. If you like what you hear, go down the rabbit hole. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Tension Pets Expresso Plaza CD In just a few tracks, this Chicago group is able to explore a lot of exciting territory. From bad-vibe carnival punk to more earnest (if unhinged) punk-inflected indie, this group is clearly confident while at play. Talk about adventures in sound and richness of ideas, and yet while some bands can stretch themselves too thin, this band seems uncannily aware of their strengths (which are many). This is squiggly, artsy weirdo music, but heavy thanks to a syrupy synth underlying it all. The vocals are howling and manic, but stuck to the rhythm in a way that all but demands you shout along. One of the most singular, fun, and powerful releases of the year. Reviewer Luke Henley Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Truth or Dare A Slogan You Can Get Behind CD Remember those bad Punk Goes\u2026 compilations? Punk Goes Pop , Punk Goes \u201980s , Punk Goes Crunk , etc.? Remember KIDZ BOP? This sounds like Punk Goes KIDZ BOP . Yeeesh. Skip this and blast some CHUMPED instead. Reviewer D. Gregory Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Whiskey Bats DCxPC Live & Dead, Volume 7 EP Another edition of DCxPC\u2019s Live & Dead series which sees the featured band contributing a handful of both live and studio-recorded songs (\u201clive\u201d and \u201cdead,\u201d get it?). This time around we\u2019ve got Pennsylvania\u2019s WHISKEY BATS bringing us two tracks from the studio, and two live tracks from Camp Punksylvania in the summer of 2024. This is your typical pop punk/orgcore affair, sounding a bit like DILLINGER FOUR meets LAWRENCE ARMS meets DEAR LANDLORD. You know the deal. I\u2019ll always go to bat for these DCxPC releases. This is the type of pure punk archiving that you just don\u2019t see anymore. The live recordings are raw, unedited, and uncut. You can hear every fuck-up as well as every victory. It might sound a bit ironic, but that\u2019s pure perfection to me. I really appreciate what DCxPC has been doing and you should too. Grab this slab and a couple of their other releases. You will not regret it. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label DCxPC Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 \u504f\u57f7\u75c7\u8005 (Paranoid) Vanished Resilience / False Control 7\u2033 \u504f\u57f7\u75c7\u8005 continue to exert mastery over D-takt in a way that few others even approach. Of a piece aesthetically with a slew of recent releases, this two-song ripper embodies the band\u2019s general imperative: the perfection of a craft. Distinct from so many dis-clones in form and function, I think of PARANOID as \u201cboutique\u201d D-beat. To the matter at hand, both tracks unsurprisingly rip. Upbeat and punk forward on both accounts, the topside \u201cVanished Resilience\u201d contains a fun trick where they switch from a fast, raging D-beat to a slower (still raging) D-beat. It may sound minor, but this is exactly the type of punk acrobatics that a lesser band would never consider, much less pull off so seamlessly. If you\u2019re not sufficiently lured in by the rad art, this moment alone makes for required listening. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label D-Takt & R\u00e5punk / Paranoid Northern Discs Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Added Dimensions Jane From Preoccupied America LP Richmond, Virginia consistently churns out great bands of all stripes, and ADDED DIMENSIONS are certainly no exception. Discordant garage with danceable grooves and unexpected harmonic layers. Art-tarnished if not fully damaged, the SWELL MAPS reference is fitting. They don\u2019t sound much like GRASS WIDOW or VIVIAN GIRLS, though both of those bands spring to mind. Catchy and streamlined without being simplistic or saccharine. Out of the fertile bed of minimalism flowers a vine yielding complex fruit. Citric, sweet, with a touch of bitterness\u2026remarkable and delectable. I dig it more with each listen. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Domestic Departure Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Big Laugh Days of Disarray LP Possible swan song from this Milwaukee hardcore band, and it\u2019s a ripper. This 12\u201d EP contains four tracks of complex punk, mixing big riffs, metallic palm-muted chugging, and layers of intricate sonic variations that keep each moment exciting like a blend of INSIDE OUT\u2019s attitude with FUCKED UP\u2019s compositional intricacy. The whole record is great, but \u201cVacation\u201d stands out with its blend of aggression and textural minor-key fuzz. Check this one out, and let\u2019s cross our fingers that it\u2019s not the last from BIG LAUGH. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Convulse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Crude Image Crude Image cassette New London-based hardcore punk project from Lindsay Corstorphine of VIOLIN. CRUDE IMAGE cites inspiration from a few corners of the world, but the Midwest influence is most prominent. All of the instruments are quick, muscular, and tight, and the vocalist sounds like they popped a few blood vessels laying these tracks down. A real pressure cooker of a record, For fans of INMATES and the HELL. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Disolvente Guerra cassette Some mid-tempo headnodders from Barcelona\u2019s DISOLVENTE. Nothing too complicated here; this is very much your meat-and- patatas bravas UK82-flavoured street punk. It does chug along at a decent pace, but is nothing that\u2019ll stay with me beyond the end of the record. I\u2019m sure they are a laugh live, at the least.

Gordon\u2019s tone is sultry and warm, as if his tenor sax had polished off a few glasses of scotch before each take. When he takes the lead, there\u2019s nothing provocative or flamboyant happening \u2014 he knows that the key to ballads isn\u2019t the number of notes in any given measure, but the quality and character of each one.

Airing every third Sunday of the month, RFAD on dublab features the pairing of\u00a0Tyler Wilcox\u2019s Doom and Gloom from the Tomb and\u00a0Chad DePasquale\u2019s New Happy Gathering. This month, Chad kicks things off with a deep-cut heavy 80th birthday tribute to Neil Young, followed by Tyler\u2019s mix of (mostly) 1970s neo-noir thriller soundtrack situations + adjacent library music grooves. Sunday, 4-6pm PT. Shaun Harris :: S/T (1973) Posted on November 14, 2025 November 14, 2025 After the tumultuous departure of legendary cult outfit The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, the eponymous 1973 folk rock offering from Shaun Harris is a gem best reserved for those with a penchant for sadness presented through a jagged, downright sunny orchestral filter. An oddity on several fronts, the startling and heavy introspective themes clash with symphonic, brimming sunshine pop arrangements. Like a true early seventies west LA studio project, the sessions feature Wrecking Crew heavy hitters like Carole Kay and Larry Knechtel, with Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys even contributing backing vocals. Liam Kazar :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on November 13, 2025 November 13, 2025 In the four years since the release of his debut record Due North , Liam Kazar hasn\u2019t exactly been silent. Be it on stage or in the studio, his contributions to the sounds artists like Hannah Cohen, Sam Evian, Kevin Morby, and Jeff Tweedy are tasteful and distinct. You know you\u2019ll be in safe hands when you see him on stage or in the credits. But this month saw the release of Pilot Light \u2014a sophomore album that couldn\u2019t be further from the stereotypical slump. Joseph Kamaru :: Heavy Combination 1966 \u2013 2007 Posted on November 13, 2025 November 11, 2025 n the 1960s and 1970s, as Kenya made the difficult transition from colony to functioning democracy, Joseph Kamaru sang the soundtrack, bringing messages of national pride, anti-corruption, class betrayal and gender politics to an emerging nation. This 17-track compilation spans Kamaru\u2019s entire career, with tracks from as early as the mid-1960s and as late as 1988. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on November 12, 2025 November 12, 2025 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. The majority of tonight\u2019s show can be found on the site via our friend Jocelyn Romo\u2019s AD mix All Things Are Quite Silent from 2020 \u2026 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Sister Irene O\u2019Connor ::\u00a0Fire of God\u2019s Love Posted on November 12, 2025 November 12, 2025 Originally issued by Phillips under the pseudonym Myriam Frances and long sought by vinyl collectors, Australian nun Sister Irene O\u2019Connor\u2019s 1973 album Fire of God\u2019s Love sees official reissue this week via the always reliable Freedom to Spend label. Drenched in reverb and powered by organ and fuzzy drum machine, it sounds like a holy devotional side project by Broadcast\u2014future music imbued with traditional faith. Transmissions :: Gary Lachman Posted on November 12, 2025 November 12, 2025 This week, we present a conversation with writer, rock & roller, and esoteric scholar Gary Lachman, author of a new memoir, \u2060 Touched By the Presence: From Blondie\u2019s Bowery and Rock and Roll to Magic and the Occult .\u2060 It is, Lachman charts his journey from a young New Jersey misfit immersed in comic books and paperback fiction to his days playing bass in Blondie as the band rose to stardom from the New York City punk underground. Natural Information Society :: Perseverance Flow Posted on November 12, 2025 November 12, 2025 Perseverance Flow does everything its title promises. It perseveres, certainly, moving with a stubborn intent in a way that feels both mechanical and wholly organic: it\u2019s a machine made of wood and leather and human effort. And it flows, in its own stuttering way with the certainty of water going downhill.\u00a0Natural Information Society has long favored both repetition and length; this 37-minute single cut album simply takes those inclinations to their logical conclusion.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
