            <li><b>Starscourge - Conqueror of the Stars – Betwixt Sundered Seraphim, the Lands Between Bleed</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Blackened Death Metal, a relevant extreme metal genre. The album is inspired by Elden Ring, which the reviewer describes as 'obtuse, difficult, and uniquely itself' and a 'precious piece of art.' This suggests the music might also strive for artistic depth and uniqueness, aligning with your criteria, though the description focuses more on the inspiration than the music itself.</i></span></li><li><b>George Winston - December</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The strong connection to John Fahey, described as his 'true heir in music and vision,' indicates significant artistic lineage and depth within Americana/folk, a genre you appreciate. The music is noted as 'compelling' and 'deliberate,' suggesting artistic value beyond mere background ambience.</i></span></li><li><b>This Is Lorelei - Holo Boy</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Listed under 'Experimental' genre, which is a strong indicator for your criteria for innovation and artistic challenge.</i></span></li><li><b>In the Woods... - Otra</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: In the Woods...' progressive/avant-garde black metal style aligns with your interest in challenging extreme metal like Oranssi Pazuzu, making it worth a manual review despite the moderate Sputnik score. Their reputation suggests artistic ambition.</i></span></li><li><b>HEALTH - Conflict DLC</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: HEALTH's industrial/noise rock sound offers a caustic and experimental edge, aligning with your taste for challenging alternative and heavy music from bands like Helmet and Converge. Manual review recommended due to genre alignment but absence of specific descriptive terms in the input.</i></span></li><li><b>Judas Priest - Painkiller</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Classic heavy metal from a highly relevant genre. The description 'red-hot' indicates quality, but lacks explicit terms for innovation or profound artistic challenge, leading to a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Monachopsis - The Carcass Choir</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as 'techdeathmess,' implying a complex, possibly chaotic technical death metal sound which could align with the user's interest in challenging and non-generic extreme metal.</i></span></li><li><b>DagdrÃ¸m - Schauder</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Melodic Black Metal, a relevant genre. The reviewer states it 'regularly circulates on my listening rotation' and is 'one of the coolest melodic black metal albums released this year,' also noting it received 'very little fanfare,' suggesting it's not a commercial play. This indicates artistic merit, but the description lacks the specific keywords for innovation or profound depth to score higher.</i></span></li><li><b>Nicola Alesini - Marco Polo</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Ambient is not a core genre but not explicitly avoided, especially when described as 'minimal, layered and discreet' and involving respected collaborators like David Sylvian, Roger Eno, and Harold Budd. The 'fourth world' descriptor suggests unique fusion and artistic merit, making it worth manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Mackeeper - Oh Canada</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The debut single is described as 'poignant', which aligns with your criteria for emotional depth. Given it's a new artist and the strong descriptor, it's worth a manual review to assess the genre and full artistic merit.</i></span></li><li><b>Kara-Lis Coverdale - A Series of Actions in a Sphere of Forever / Changes in Air</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Kara-Lis Coverdale is known for experimental electronic music; her album being listed under 'Rock' suggests an artistic fusion or experimental departure, which could align with your interest in innovation.</i></span></li><li><b>Amalekim - Shir Hashirim</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Melodic Black Metal, a genre you appreciate. While the description is somewhat meta, it notes prior praise for the band's work as a highlight, suggesting artistic merit, though the description for this specific album is less explicit about innovation.</i></span></li><li><b>Jailcell Recipes - Artifact for an Empty Tank World</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: A reissue compilation of a hardcore band, moving from 'heavily YOUTH OF TODAY-influenced genesis' to 'LEATHERFACE-styled coda'. While a strong genre fit (hardcore) and historically significant, the description lacks the critical keywords of innovation or emotional depth for this specific compilation, warranting a manual review.</i></span></li>

It features 'Marathi-language vocals and Bollywood-influenced dancefloor rhythms', existing as a 'seething punk band'.
