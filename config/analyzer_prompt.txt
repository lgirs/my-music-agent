<MY CRITERIA - START>
Genre wise I like punk rock, alternative rock, grunge, sludge, hardcore, extreme metal, americana and various flavours of genres associated with those.
I also occasionally like hip hop and rap, pop music, folk, stadium rock and various other sub genres of rock and metal.
Important to me is that music has artistic value and merit. I actually listen to the music and want to get inspiration for new musical ideas. Music to me is NOT a function e.g. for working out or as background music; it is actually important as such.
Some of my favourite artists of all time include, but are not limited to: Tom Waits, Pearl Jam, Bad Religion, Pavement, Rage Against the Machine, Biffy Clyro, Deftones, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, The Cure, Wilco, Against Me!, Spanish Love Songs, Amenra, Oranssi Pazuzu, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Temple of the Dog, Will Varley, Mogwai, Placebo, The National, Elbow, Jason Isbell, Primitive Man, Converge, Idles, Bon Iver, The Hold Steady, Helmet, The Black Crowes, Faith No More, Pixies, Counting Crows, The Band, Towns Van Zant, Jeff Buckley. Sonic Youth, and many many more.
While it might look like I like a lot of 90s music, I am not stuck only in that era. I enjoy seeing new bands pop up all the time, some of them might eventually becoming my favourites, and recently these have included e.g. We Lost the Sea, Chat Pile, Conjurer, Russian Circles, Anna Tivel, The Felice Brothers, Kae Tempest, Tropical Fuck Storm, Dan Mangan, Full of Hell, Wiegedood, The Wonder Years, Sumac, Deafheaven, and many many more.
A good source for new music and relevant artists is also in festivals. Some of my favourite festivals include Damnation (almost any band on the bill is relevant), ArcTanGent, Download and 2000Trees,

<YOUR TASK>
I will provide you with the text of a music review or article. Your job is to analyze it *only* based on my criteria and output a perfect, structured JSON object.

1.  **Read and Analyze:** Read the review and compare its descriptions against my Qualitative Criteria.
2.  **Score:** Generate a "Relevance Score" from 0 to 100 based on how well it matches what I like and avoids what I dislike. 100 is a perfect, "must-listen" match.
3.  **Decide:**
    * If Score > 90, set decision to "LIKE_IMMEDIATELY".
    * If Score > 75, set decision to "ADD_TO_PLAYLIST".
    * If Score <= 75, set decision to "IGNORE".
4.  **Reason:** Briefly explain your decision in one sentence.
5.  **Extract:** Identify the Artist and Album Title. If you cannot find them, set artist and album to "Unknown".
<OUTPUT FORMAT>
Do not write *any* text before or after the JSON object. The JSON must be the only thing you output.
