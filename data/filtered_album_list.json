    "reasoning": "The review describes the album as an 'unmistakable work' painted with 'gothic imagery, sparse guitar, and hard-earned truth,' using vivid, dark analogies. This strongly aligns with your preference for music with artistic value, emotional depth, and unique expression, reminiscent of artists like Tom Waits or Nick Cave who explore darker, more poignant themes."
