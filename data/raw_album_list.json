Facebook Instagram RSS Twitter Powered by Genesis Peace, Twang, and Turkey Grease: A 2025 Thanksgiving Toast to Kathleen Edwards (and Everyone) Thursday, November 27, 2025 By Tom Osborne The turkey\u2019s in the oven, somebody\u2019s hiding the good bourbon, and there\u2019s at least one family member asking, \u201cWait, who is this?\u201d every time a new song comes on. Meanwhile, here in Twangville, we\u2019re doing what we always do: sharing recs, falling in love with new records, and giving thanks for the music that gets us through it all. Filed Under: Reviews Tagged With: Kathleen Edwards GA-20 \u2013 Orphans Wednesday, November 26, 2025 By Bill Wilcox About 12 years ago I caught a Charlie Musselwhite show at Blues Alley, DC\u2019s great jazz club (that occasionally features blues artists lately). Musselwhite of course was great, but the young lead guitarist, Matthew Stubbs, piqued my intrest so much I sought out his early solo albums \u2013 Soul Bender and Medford & Main. What [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Blues , Reviews , Rock , Rockabilly , Roots , Soul/R&B Tagged With: GA-20 , Matthew Stubbs Trish Plays Bass \u2013 Bluegrass Love Songs, Volume 1 Wednesday, November 19, 2025 By Shawn Underwood To paraphrase a friend of mine, people go to a classical music performance to hear the composer\u2019s music. They go to a bluegrass show to hear the performer\u2019s music, whether written by themselves or someone else. So I found it intriguing to listen to Trish Imbrogno\u2019s (aka Trish Plays Bass) debut EP. After 25 years [\u2026] Filed Under: Bluegrass , Reviews Tagged With: Trish Plays Bass The Tasty Kings \u2013 The Kindness of Numbers Thursday, November 13, 2025 By Shawn Underwood I\u2019m not a lawyer, which undoubtedly enables a number of people to sleep better at night. So the difference between a band and a collective is partially lost on me. The one thing that does seem to be the case is that it enables an easier time of rotating musicians in and out of the [\u2026] Filed Under: Reviews Tagged With: The Tasty Kings \u201cI Don\u2019t Like You\u201d \u2013 a Premiere From Low Roller Wednesday, November 12, 2025 By Mayer Danzig Longtime readers know I love a good kiss-off song.\u00a0\u201cI Don\u2019t Like You,\u201d\u00a0the title of Low Roller\u2019s new single, seems prime for the list. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s actually the opposite. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t like you, but I love you anyway,\u201d singer-songwriter Veronica Davila declares. The song recognizes that conflict can be healthy in a relationship [\u2026] Filed Under: Reviews , Streams Tagged With: Low Roller Gurf Morlix \u2013 Bristlecone Wednesday, November 05, 2025 By Rubis Corbeau With Bristlecone, Gurf Morlix once again delivers an unmistakable work\u2014painted in his palette of gothic imagery, sparse guitar, and hard-earned truth. This is the kind of album that feels like flying across Seven Mile Bridge at night in a hearse with the windows rolled down, narrowly escaping the Devil, yelling \u201cStep On it Skinner!\u201d It\u2019s [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Reviews , Singer/Songwriter Tagged With: Gurf Morlix John Francis O\u2019Mara \u2013 Forbidden Hymns Wednesday, October 29, 2025 By Shawn Underwood The United States\u2019 Bible Belt and the strongholds of American country music share a lot of geographical overlap. Virginian John Francis O\u2019Mara, with his Theology degree and collaborations with Nashville\u2019s finest, including Kenny Vaughn and John Carter Cash, likewise stands firmly planted in both camps.

    "page_text": "Reviews  - Metal Temple Magazine Menu Reviews Interviews Reports News Filters Order by Order by Order by Newest Oldest Best (10 - 1) None Search Search Search Rating Range Rating Range Reset Date Range Date Range Date Range Clear Reset All Reviews One Way To Glory Not Fragile I have also reviewed their debut EP \u201cWho Dares Wins\u201d, and you\u2019ll find that as the one next to this one on the METAL TEMPLE site. What I get from listening to their debut EP as well as this compilation album is that NOT FRAGILE has been very constant in the quality of their songs. Nowhere are they superb or out-of-this-world brilliant, but neither can you catch them being subpar at any time at all. Who Dares Wins Not Fragile I have to say that as a debut you can do a lot worse than \u201cWho Dares Wins\u201d, while at the same time it will be hard to do much better. In My Head Kill Ritual Musically the band have evolved in such a way that it will be easier for new admirers to step in, whilst those who already liked what KILL RITUAL did so far will be able to continue their admiration. \u201cIn My Head\u201d is that good, yes. The Hardest Thing About Being God Is That No One Believes Me Blindfolded and Led to the Woods To summarize the album, in addition to the chainsaw intensity and its bruising, take no prisoners nature, I love the shifting pacing. It can take off like an errant rocket or slow to a dangerous crawl. The latter moments are most frightening, because they give you more time to think and to consider what lies in front of you. Even in the best of circumstances, love can sting like a scorpion. Maybe all of us have a little serial killer locked up inside us somewhere. Forever Grailknights GRAILKNIGHTS deliver what their fans expect from them: a journey into the GRAILKNIGHTS universe. To understand the sound and lyrics of \u201cForever\u201d, you must let go and enter the journey Darker Fates Hellbearer \u201cDarker Fates\u201d is classical Thrash Metal, it is a fast and aggressive delivery of tight guitar riffs, crushing basslines, and spine-chilling melodies Regime Juliet Ruin One of the biggest surprises of the year for me is the new\u00a0Juliet Ruin\u00a0EP entitled\u00a0Regime.\u00a0This [\u2026] VOID AVIANA Imagine, if you will, a concert. The lights dim. People wait in anticipation as the [\u2026] In Situ Maudits One of the things that the album does best is create a variety of moods. Some of them are depressing, others are introspective, and still others are somber. The differences are subtle, but each one can make you feel something completely different. That in a nutshell is the album\u2026an offering of songs that you can unwrap and feel for yourself. Occultation Monograf \u201cOccultation\u201d by MONGRAF kind of blew me away. It suffers only from its brevity. I mean, I could have done with two more tracks or a second disk or full-length A24 movie. Revelry of a Maltreated Jade Hagzissa \u201cRevelry of a Maltreated Jade\u201d is an enigma of an album. The end effect is an album that demands repeat listens in various states of consciousness. Learning the Secrets of Acid Umulamahri Thinking man\u2019s Death Metal? Most definitely. For me, the album plays like a post-apocalyptic landscape of death, disease, and ruin. What\u2019s left on earth is empty and desolate, but what scurries under the surface is very much alive. The genre boundaries for Death Metal are so constricting, but UMULAMAHRI forges their own path within the fire-scorched landscape with a clear vision and an unmatched intensity. Eternal Hell awaits the listener. Symphony of Chaos Black Soul Horde \"BLACK SOUL HORDE\" is a heavy metal band hailing all the way from Greece and [\u2026] Children of the Night Torchlight Parade From the morgue to the stage. This band gives you all the theatrics you are looking for and then some. Blind Leading The Blind Sweet Freedom SWEET FREEDOM? Really? So, this is not RAINBOW, or DEEP PURPLE? It\u2019s not even WHITESNAKE or even MSG? And the singer isn\u2019t JOE LYNN TURNER or his little brother? Are you sure? Well, if you are sure, I\u2019ll go ahead and review this as the debut album by this current version of SWEET FREEDOM. Psychedelic Enigma Them Musically these guys are clearly very well versed in reading each-others minds and complementing what they do in such a way that it all sounds as coherent as superglue. It makes going through the 56 minutes of playing time that \u201cPsychedelic Enigma\u201d holds rather easy to endure. Firebrand Ring Van M\u00f6bius I can tell you that if you aren\u2019t giving your full attention to the music that is being played, you are in danger of finding it long, winding, very expansive and even boring from time to time. Whilst when you do listen carefully, preferably with your headphones on and your eyes closed, you will be transported into a world of beautiful surroundings and atmospheric soundscapes. Save Us From Ourselves Mattador Hailing from Puerto Rico, Mattador combined the slick, hook-driven sound of bands like Dokken and [\u2026] Tale of the Two: Dusk Dragon Throne I now know what a koto, an erhu, and a shakuhachi are! Songs Of White Lion Volume III Mike Tramp So for the final instalment in this trilogy of \u201cSongs Of White Lion\u201d comes \u201cVolume [\u2026] Society\u2019s Pact With Satan Cathedral On this EP you hear all the elements that were needed to make CATHEDRAL into the band they were. It\u2019s all properly and expertly put together in just one song. If this is their last hoorah, then the band couldn\u2019t have gone out in a better way than with \u201cSociety\u2019s Pact With Satan\u201d. Hallucinating Anxiety (Reissue) Cadaver I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Death metal fanatic, a Thrash Metal nutcase, a NAPALM DEATH admirer or even a Grindcore groveller, you need to take your time and listen to CADAVER on this reinvented version of \u201cHallucinating Anxiety\u201d. I can assure you that you\u2019ll like it at least as much as I do, if not more. Light And Desolation Blizaro The world is a wonderful place, where a lot of interesting things happen. Some of those will enthral you, while others will disappoint you. The fact that you never know beforehand which is the case, you get and embrace the surprise. Well, that is definitely the case with BLIZARO, a one man band from Rochester in the state of New York. Warren Of Necrosis Black Rabbit BLACK RABBIT has come out stronger this time. When I was listening to \u201cChronolysis\u201d, it felt that the band just let go, and damned be the consequences. It made for some uneven levels on that wile, while on \u201cWarren Of Necrosis\u201d it is a lot more in sync with each other. Spelled By Fire Angelo Perlepes' Mystery What I am listening to is a combination of the music that ALCATRAZZ used to make on their first albums, when YNGWIE MALMSTEEN was the guitarist in question, combined with the debut album of YNGWIE MALMSTEEN\u2019S RISING FORCE and even some GRAHAM BONNET era RAINBOW. Spear of Conquest Summoning Hellgates Overall, the album was delightfully wicked, and the vocals were every bit as dark and aggressive as the music. If you want to take a fiery joy ride downward into Hell, climb aboard. Cloven Tongues of Fire The Ominous Circle Overall, their amalgam of Death and Black Metal was indeed both dark and intense. They build a cocoon of shadows with the deftness of a spider crafting a web and just leave it there to ensnare anyone with a morbid curiosity with their death. Execration Bloodtruth Yes, this was a great listen. Yes, I want more. The Fire Brethren Abominator The amount of times I've compared this album to white noise is weird... Reformatiom Str\u00e5le ...unpolished polished-ness... Golden Tears of Love and Sorrow Orob France is one of the hot beds for modern Metal these days. The album walks a feral line of Post-Black Metal and the expanding horizons of Progressive Metal that it keeps brushing up against like a hand on a forbidden door. It\u2019s harsh, but not primitive, expansive, but never polished to sterility. The interplay creates a kind of emotional chiaroscuro. You feel the darkness, but you can also sense the shapes surviving within it. It\u2019s music that claws upward even as it sinks deeper, and that contradiction is what makes it compelling. Bianca Bianca This was an uncommon sound, fueled by dual opposing vocal styles. They lure you in, with seductive notes, and then eat your soul with all the fire and hatred of Hell itself. The music undulates with the vocals\u2026at times, as raging as a tsunami, and at other times, calm. The fires burn deeply on the album, like a festering wound that has added salt for more pain, and topped with a barbed dagger inserted into the lesion. Pestilential Hymns Thaumaturgy The 2025 release of Pestilential Hymns by Thaumaturgy features eight tracks (an ADHD'ers version of 46 minutes) of pure grind-hate-death metal core encased in a hurricane of filth. Power of Discretion Dave Tinelt Dave Tinelt, Power of Discretion is a raw and hearty, traditional, all metal and power memorable reverse, snap-back ball cap tip to the skateboarding, convenient store, arcade playing child terror of the 80\u2019s I was and still am. Archaeoptimist Spock\u2019s Beard This is one of Progressive Rock\u2019s finest album of the year. Just quirky enough to keep it interesting and intriguing, they explore plenty of unchartered territory on the album but always find their way home. Their musicianship is outstanding, and I did indeed find that the album has a retroactive feeling to it while staying within the modern scene. Magnificent!

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

REVIEW: Otherwise \u2013 Some Kind of Alchemy Lizi had a listen to Otherwise\u2019s hard rock EP Some Kind of Alchemy! REVIEW: Fit For a King \u2013 Lonely God Fit For a King coming up on almost 20 years as a band and honestly, it\u2019s impressive how consistent they\u2019ve remained throughout their career. Everyone has their favourite records of course; but FFAK\u2019s discography is one that I\u2019ve majorly only heard praise for and considering they\u2019re coming up on their 8th full-length album; that isn\u2019t something you find in a whole lot of bands. They have continuously tweaked and polished their sound without straying too far from their strengths and this remains the case for their upcoming LP Lonely God. The record contains everything their fans would want out of a FFAK project and more, finding the band not only in a stride but with the addition of some new flavours as well. REVIEW: Fox Lake \u2013 New World Heat Fox Lake have made quite the name for themselves over the last few years. Coming out of Denver in 2017, Fox Lake have established a chaos of sound that blurs the lines between metalcore, hardcore, hip-hop and nu-metal. Back in 2023 is when I personally came across the band with the explosive Fear and Loathing EP which not only became one of my favourite releases that year, but it also made its waves across the metalcore and hardcore communities relentlessly. Now, two years later the band have signed with MNRK Heavy and have released sophomore album New World Heat. 1 2 3 - 104 >> Please leave this field empty SUBSCRIBE We keep your data private and share your data only with third parties that make this service possible.

Grand Theft Auto V Nov 18, 2014 \u2022 Rated M The sprawling sun-soaked metropolis of Los Santos is chock full of self-help coaches, starlets and C-List celebrities, once on top of the media world, now struggling to stay relevant in time of economic malaise and lowest-common-denominator reality TV.

Half-Life 2 Nov 16, 2004 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2004 PC Game of the Year]  By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies.

Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- are counting on him. [Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience. After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture, a city hidden beneath the sea.

Take control of your world by hacking mechanical devices, commandeering security turrets and crafting unique items critical to your very survival. Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels, explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game.

Not only did the album further capitalize on their songwriting abilities and Ramos\u2019 insane vocal talents, but it opened up a slew of headlining tours, closing festival slots, and untold amounts of fans.\u201d MOAR Shore. Death Obvious \u2013 Death Obvious Review By Andy-War-Hall on December 2, 2025 in Reviews , Avant-Garde , Black Metal , Death Metal , Doom Metal , 17 comments \u201cBack in August, I went goo-goo over an avant-black duo under Transcending Obscurity called Hexrot and, as a lowly N00b, awarded their debut Formless Ruin of Oblivion a \u201cGreat\u201d designation. Flash forward, and sloshing through the promo sump comes an avant-black duo under Transcending Obscurity called Death Obvious , offering their self-titled debut. Composed of vocalist Lea Lavey and everything-else-er Sima Sioux, this Finnish duo reveal high aspirations with claims of \u201ccrafting music as it suits their demented vision in a recklessly intuitive manner\u201d while pitching Death Obvious for fans of visionary acts like Blut aus Nord , Deathspell Omega , Veilburner and\u00e2\u0080\u0094looky!\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hexrot .\u201d Sump struggles. Frozen Land \u2013 Icemelter Review By Twelve on December 1, 2025 in Reviews , Power Metal , 11 comments \u201cI have such a soft spot in my heart for Frozen Land . After writing my first-ever review for Angry Metal Guy, I remember feeling shaky. It went through quite a few revisions. My second, Frozen Land \u00e2\u0080\u0099s eponymous debut, was, comparatively, simple. Their 1999 Euro power metal meets 2001 Euro power metal vision made for a catchy, delightfully fun album, and my enjoyment for it showed in my writing\u00e2\u0080\u0094still my favorite intro to any review I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve written. So it is to my great astonishment that these Finns are now on album number three with Icemelter .\u201d Metal melts the ice. Der Weg Einer Freiheit \u2013 Innern [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Thus Spoke on December 1, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Atmospheric Black Metal , Black Metal , Post-Metal , 41 comments \u201cMy experience with Der Weg Einer Freiheit differs quite substantially from our resident Eldritch reviewer. Perhaps because my first taste was 2017\u2019s Finisterre , I never saw it, nor later Noktvrn (2021) as disappointing steps down from previous Stellar heights. In my eyes, the path that Der Weg Einer Freiheit followed in the last decade is not only a natural extension of their introspective, emotionally-charged black metal, but it has also enabled them to expand and enhance this consistently potent core to new levels.\u201d Freiheit 451. \u00c3\u0084nterbila \u2013 Avart Review By Grin Reaper on November 30, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , Folk Metal , 22 comments \u201cBilled as blackened folk metal and boasting a sound that will remind listeners of the aughts-era Darkthrone , \u00c3\u0084nterbila returns with sophomore album Avart . Three years removed from their self-titled debut, the foursome from G\u00c3\u00a4vleborg County, Sweden, retains the core sonic principles of \u00c3\u0084nterbila and dunks them into the muck, invoking a darker, grimier aura.\u201d Darker thrones? Doubtsower \u2013 The Past Melts Away with a Sneer Review By ClarkKent on November 29, 2025 in Reviews , Avant-Garde , Doom Metal , Experimental Metal , Funeral Doom , Industrial Metal , Sludge Metal , 12 comments \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly November, and my month of doom, has flown by. It seems the constant exposure to slow-paced music has made the days move faster, not slower. For my final November doom promo, what could be more appropriate than one described as \u201cone long song funeral doom?\u201d While the Welsh doom band containing this descriptor, Doubtsower , is new to me, the man behind the project, Matt Strangis, has three previous releases dating back to 2021.\u201d Doubt is a doom killer. Halocraft \u2013 The Sky Will Remember / To Leave a Single Wolf Alive [Things You Might Have Missed 2025] By Killjoy on November 28, 2025 in Things You Might Have Missed 2025 , Instrumental Metal , Not Metal , 9 comments \u201cI find the idea of double albums fascinating. While in many cases they may indicate an unchecked surge of inspiration or an unwillingness to self-edit, there are instances when the decision can feel genuinely appropriate. Halocraft , a (mostly) instrumental post-rock quartet from Greece, opted to split the final entry of a multi-album story into two parallel endings. According to their respective Bandcamp pages, The Sky Will Remember is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cimaginary happy ending,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whereas To Leave a Single Wolf Alive is the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue dark ending.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u201d Double miss! Carnal Savagery \u2013 Crypt of Decay Review By Steel Druhm on November 28, 2025 in Reviews , Death Metal , 19 comments \u201cAdvanced scientific studies indicate that the style of metal known as \u201cSwedeath\u201d will not die and may, in fact, be incapable of being killed. The foundation created by Entombed and Dismember in the early 90s cemented the \u201cStockholm Sound\u201d so deeply in musical bedrock that forecasters predict it could function like an everflowing stream for untold aeons. Enter Sweden\u2019s Carnal Savagery . This gruesome duo have gone in big on the Swedeath formula, releasing 6 albums of it since 2020,  all of which pay loving homage to the genre\u2019s forefathers.\u201d Back to the crypts of the dismembered entombed. Suncraft \u2013 Welcome to the Coven Review By Spicie Forrest on November 27, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , Stoner Rock , 50 comments \u201cI first became acquainted with stoner rock while attending college and skiing in Salt Lake City. Whether carving the corduroy or taking face shots of bottomless pow, the raucous groove of the style made for a great soundtrack. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve largely moved on to heavier and less accessible pastures, but once in a while, something brings me back. This time, it was Suncraft , a five-piece formed in Oslo, Norway in 2017; I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let a genre tag like \u00e2\u0080\u009cstoner/black/pop\u00e2\u0080\u009d pass by unyoinked. We missed their 2021 debut, Flat Earth Rider , but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here to give their sophomore effort, Welcome to the Coven , the proper AMG treatment.\u201d Turkey in the oven, surrounded by the coven. Blut Aus Nord \u2013 Ethereal Horizons Review By Alekhines Gun on November 26, 2025 in Reviews , Black Metal , 78 comments \u201cSometimes it\u2019s all a question of perspective.  Among the most prominent and influential of French black metal, the sometimes-solo-project-sometimes-three-piece entity known as Blut Aus Nord have manifested four or five entirely different versions of themselves over the last thirty(!) years. Occasionally, their albums are released in sets of connected sounds and themes, and other times you can be exposed to one idea you fall in love with, only for the band to pivot away into something new and unexpected; imagine the surprise fans of Fathers of the Icy Age must have felt first hearing The Work Which Transforms God . We are now at album sixteen, and the question isn\u2019t as much \u201cis this gonna be any good\u201d as much as \u201cwhich band is showing up today?\u201d\u201d Blut is going on here??

His tracks are lo-fi, innocent, and achingly whimsical, similar to fellow Sydneysiders TEE VEE REPAIRMANN and Portland\u2019s CHEERY CHEEKS. GEE TEE has been referred to as the Australian SPITS, but on their track, they slow it down with a tune that sounds beautifully crafted like NOBUNNY covering DANIEL JOHNSTON in a bedroom on a four-track. Reviewer Tim Janchar Label Prison Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Alibi Alibi cassette Yet another contemporary German throwback to the Neue Deutsche Welle, and I\u2019m not mad about it. Opener \u201cIrgendwas Ist Immer\u201d builds plenty of tension and drama over three-and-a-half minutes, and there\u2019s a sharp, Zickzack\u2019d angularity cutting through in the staccato guitar stabs and rigid rhythms of \u201cAttit\u00fcde\u201d and \u201cZust\u00e4nde,\u201d but on a whole, Kiel\u2019s ALIBI are far less shrouded and goth-influenced than the Berlin-based contingent of modern XMAL DEUTSCHLAND disciples like AUS, DIE SCHIEFE BAHN, and MISERE, landing somewhere closer to the second HANS-A-PLAST LP that bridged their late \u201970s speedy punk spark with an expanded early \u201980s post-punk palette. Impressively tight and locked-in for what\u2019s essentially a first demo, and if whatever comes next plays up even more of the latent art-damage that I\u2019m picking up on here, it could be genuinely savage. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Flennen Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Baby Tyler Sucker With a Dream LP BABY TYLER is back and better than ever. I\u2019ll admit it, on the first listen I wasn\u2019t impressed. It was exactly what I expected, hardcore-tinged garage punk rippers. Nothing more, nothing less. The first two tracks didn\u2019t do much for me at first, but the third track caught my attention with the lyric \u201cAnd if you give it nothing / What do you expect in return?\u201d This stuck out to me, and days later it was still in my head. Tracks six through eight expand on the sound of the first few songs and have some of my favorite moments on the LP. The horn breakdown on \u201cRinse Repeat\u201d is a great example, as is the menacing vocal on \u201cGood Motivator.\u201d The bass and drums really stand out and work together seamlessly to move the songs forward, while the guitar takes a back seat and adds subtle flavor where needed. Elsewhere, the bass can be overpowering at times, and I wish the guitars hit a little harder. Lyrically, vocalist Tyler Fassnacht angrily questions his dedication to the craft, the idea of \u201csuccess,\u201d and what it means to a mid-thirties DIY punk who has spent most of his life on tour and making records. \u201cIf you give it nothing, what can you expect in return?\u201d The answer is nothing. Fucking nothing. But if you give it everything, time and time again, you may end with an LP full of piss and vinegar, yet still poppy enough to leave hooks in your head for days. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Night Bell Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Crist\u00f8 Fragments of the Inferno cassette Dark, evil-sounding hardcore punk from Los Angeles, CA. CRIST\u00d8 follows up their first digital release from two-and-a-half years ago with a ripping seven-song cassette. It might not be heard by everyone, but the songwriting and vocal patterns sound to me like the band wisely took a page or two out of the NUCLEAR ASSAULT playbook. This recording really shines when leaning into the speed-metal-inspired aspects of their sound. With the cassette release only limited to a mere fifteen copies, good luck getting your hands on one. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 D.U.N.C.E. Demo 1 EP Coming out of the gates sounding like a menacing version of PRISON AFFAIR and then settling in with their own thing entirely, D.U.N.C.E. does a killer job of introducing themselves to the masses with this demonstration. There is a sheen of effortlessness that coats this offering, especially on the highlight \u201cShark,\u201d that is not too unlike the energy of a SPIRITUAL CRAMP or a HANK WOOD AND THE HAMMERHEADS. Demos should seek to turn a head or grab an ear, and D.U.N.C.E. successfully stops the listener in their tracks and makes them whip their head. Excited for what\u2019s to come, but glad for what we\u2019ve got. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Human Future / No Human Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Emma Goldman Sachs Everything Up Until Now cassette Get ready for some scratchy, growly vocals. These guys were playful, diving into some more Western sounds or kind of groovy punk. The vocals stand out to me the most, as they really take the song into different places. Super fun band. Reviewer Emma Miller Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Eskorbuto Anti Todo LP reissue Reissue of a classic Euskara band\u2019s classic record. In many ways, it\u2019s pretty churlish of me to try and add to the big pile of discourse around this band and release. What more is there to say that hasn\u2019t already been said? A pivotal band in the development of punk en Espanyol , and this is them in the midst of a clear purple patch. A step change from the \u201977-inspired early material into arms-aloft, \u201cwhoa\u201d-infused choruses for the ages. \u201cEs Un Crimen\u201d is surely in the pantheon of the greats by now. Unsure if we really need to add any more onto the big critical landfill surrounding this record, or indeed what the point is in remastering punk records in general, but if it encourages you to give this a listen, then do it. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Munster Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Flying Heads Flying Heads LP Tell any punk who grew up in Chicagoland that FLYING HEADS feature members from TV SLIME, and they\u2019re going to jump at it immediately. Incredible noise/crust punk that brings to mind some of the best to do it, like ELECTRO HIPPIES and DOOM. There\u2019s also a sludge element much like MELVINS and KILSLUG. This is one of those records where you have no other choice but to listen to it loud as hell\u2014it imposes that upon itself. If you\u2019re not blasting this into your eardrums, then you ain\u2019t living, friend. Chicago is known for an array of different punk-adjacent genres, but this sloppy, raucous rock\u2019n\u2019roll feels most at home to me. This pairs perfectly with an Old Style and a shot of Malort. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 G.A.Z.E. G.A.Z.E. 12\u2033 Ever wondered how PAINTBOX would sound if they were Finnish? Helsinki\u2019s Burning Spirits-influenced hardcore heroes are back with more vicious melodies. Many have tried and many have failed to emulate the sound that the Japanese NWOBHM-influenced punks crafted so well. G.A.Z.E. is an exception to that rule. They nail the style so well because they strive to retain the high-energy, uplifting mood that characterized the classics like DEATH SIDE or JUDGEMENT. It\u2019s supposed to be a constant yin/yang of brutality and melody, but always very bright. The guitar leads are performed to perfection, the vocal delivery is complete with the classic gang shouting, and the songs are very unpredictable, thanks to a great usage of tempo shifts. There is even time for out-of-the-box instruments to make an appearance, like saxophone, violin, and double bass. They have studied their lesson well. Essential listening. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label D-Takt & R\u00e5punk Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 H.A.L.T. II 12\u2033 H.\u00c4.L.T. out of Vancouver, BC recently released their second full-length 12\u2033, affectionately entitled II . Their latest release brings more bop, more punk, and more goth to their already gloom-infested sound. The eight-song II is sonically dense with its shifting, danceable rhythms, intriguing organ/synth work, and gnarly guitar tones. Personally, the second song \u201cForever Dead\u201d is my favorite with its defiant perspective, and I love how that song transitions into the spectral \u201cVoices.\u201d In all, this is a fantastic work of dark delights. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Jodie Faster Saint Lundi LP Nineteen songs of feverish hardcore punk from France. No distortion, no breakdowns, no songs over 1:45, and no time to slow down! Super-political, super-fast, and the origin of Saint Lundi has me wanting to quit my job and go slam a pint! JODIE FASTER has been dishing out \u201cshort songs played fast\u201d for a decade, and it truly shows on Saint Lundi . My favorite moment on the record is when vocalist screams \u201cfuck that!\u201d during a split-second pause in \u201cS.O.R.G.A.\u201d This shit rules. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Don't Trust the Hype / Drinkin' Beer in Bandana / La Agon\u00eda De Vivir / Loner Cult / No Time / Pasidaryk Pats / Spastic Fantastic / TNS Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ryan Kidd Rock n Rule LP RYAN KIDD is rock\u2019n\u2019roll punk with sass and swagger, pulling in elements of DEAD BOYS and the SAINTS. This comes in punchy and will hook you with catchy choruses, but you\u2019ll stay for the oddball guitar work that punctuates the verses from time to time. I\u2019d be remiss to not include that some of these tunes reflect EXPLODING HEARTS and Dirtnap Records with their melody and power pop hooks. There is yelling on this Rock N Rude LP, some \u201cwoo-woo\u201ds, \u201cyaaaohh\u201ds, snotty Stiv Bators vocal stuff, and most of the songs are perfectly lyrically vague enough that you could get away with singing them around town without getting side-eyed. This record is for you if you like beer, bars, and places that have punk shows that have been around so long that smoking cigs inside has been grandfathered into the building\u2019s lease. Reviewer Tony Party Label Human B-Side Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Last Survivors / Vaxine split EP The zipper on the front of this record should be a hint of what you\u2019re in for. The release notes promise a love letter to the UK82 scene \u201corganically mixed with the sound of raw \u201980s global hardcore,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what it delivers. VAXINE (NYC) tears through three politically-charged two-minute blasts that land somewhere between DISCHARGE and CHAOS UK, with a whiff of MOT\u00d6RHEAD swagger in the intro to \u201cWar Criminals.\u201d LAST SURVIVORS (Tokyo) follow with two tracks that sound rougher, like a third-generation tape dub, but they still bring four minutes of pure basement energy. Both bands hit that sweet spot of raw, mid-range-heavy \u201980s-style punk without too much of the metallic drift some of their influences leaned into. Every song could\u2019ve been trimmed by half a minute, but it\u2019s still a strong dose of unfiltered, boots-on-the-floor hardcore. For fans of the punkiest of punk sounds, this one\u2019s worth tracking down. The high point for me was VAXINE\u2019s \u201cThread of Hate.\u201d Reviewer Jeff Cost Label General Speech Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Makin\u2019 Out Living in a Glass House LP I love this sort of thing\u2014kind of soft, kind of jangly female-fronted pop music. That said, it always has to be done well. She\u2019ll probably hate the reference, but the singer has great range and can hit highs that remind of Dolores O\u2019Riordan of the CRANBERRIES. But this one does have its moments of grittiness, with the pretty vocals occasionally drifting into distress. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Dead Broke Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 No Sector / Peracetic split EP Representing New Zealand and Nova Scotia respectively, NO SECTOR and PERACETIC prove that hardcore is still spoken fluently across the globe on this ripping split. NO SECTOR is deliciously dialed-in across their three tracks, serving up a satisfying splash of intensity in just four minutes. It\u2019s hard to pick a favorite from this addictive little set, but if I had to, it\u2019s \u201cBootcamp.\u201d Thrashier and less compressed, PERACETIC manages to shoot out six tunes in roughly the same amount of time, each one surrounding the listener like a tornado of razors. Glorious. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Sewercide Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Prise Rapide Trop Plein cassette Goddang, you ever just hear a band that means what they say and plays it well? Admit it, it happens fewer times than you think. Well, let\u2019s take a look at PRISE RAPIDE from Paris (not Texas). This music feels like it wears its heart on its sleeve, and drives it home like a stake through a vampire\u2019s heart. The hooks and melodic turns here will keep you locked in throughout its relatively short runtime (just under 30 minutes). The bass is honey bright with presence, anchoring otherwise zig-zagging melodic post-punk without ever getting too dour. It\u2019s good stuff, I don\u2019t know what else to tell ya. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Dirty Slap / Jour du Pluie / Yoyodyne Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Split System No Cops in Heaven / Pull the Trigger 7\u2033 Aussie five-piece SPLIT SYSTEM has released their third 7\u2033 of 2025, and the A-side \u201cNo Cops in Heaven\u201d is killer \u201970s-style punk with clenched-jaw propulsion. It\u2019s mid-tempo, but the rhythm section plays like they\u2019re sprinting forward at full tilt, locked into a locomotive groove that gives the song that RADIO BIRDMAN-esque push where everyone else has to keep up or get steamrolled. Guitars leave zero breathing room, and the whole thing has that piston engine momentum that made me want to play it again the second it ended. \u201cPull the Trigger\u201d doesn\u2019t hit quite as hard, but it\u2019s still a solid shot at war profiteers. The more I hear from this band, the more I dig \u2019em. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Legless / Static Shock Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Stabber Shut Up EP Sick debut from this Norwegian outfit. A potent compound of two parts USHC and one part rock\u2019n\u2019roll. A couple of the licks reminded me of early ANNIHILATION TIME. A couple more made me think of CAREER SUICIDE. Clear production works to their favor, especially when the tempo downshifts and the bassist tramps up and down the fretboard. \u201cRepeat Offender\u201d feels like the completed distillation of what they\u2019re, uh, stabbing at, but this is a tight EP from start to finish. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Kick Rock / Stab! Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Subhumans Demolition Wars Demos 2xLP Sealed Records unapologetically does it again, this time with an epic double album including SUBHUMANS\u2019 three early demos recorded before the release of their iconic first EP Religious Wars . This massive undertaking is actually a reissue as Bluurg Records had released these three recordings on a tape entitled Demolition War Parts I-III in 1981, so it\u2019s pretty unlikely anyone already has a physical copy these days anyway (beside that hammered old punk at the pub who rather embarrassingly claims that \u201cpunks were punks back in the days\u201d\u2014you know the sort, avoid at all costs). As \u201980s demos recorded cheaply at Warminster\u2019s local youth center and The Old Bell, the production is raw, but the band was already so skillful, tight, catchy, and proper energetic that it confers a new charm to otherwise well-known anthemic songs from their early period, and the record brings some further context to the band\u2019s first steps with some interviews and collages. As a bonus, it even has three unreleased numbers in case you needed additional arguments. If you have never heard SUBHUMANS, I envy you, because you are about to discover a wonderful slice of snotty UK punk. This might not be the greatest point of entry into the catalog of one of the most respected and most consistent anarcho-punk bands still playing and delivering (which is more than can be said about legions of \u201creformed punk legends\u201d), and 60 minutes of raw versions of (even undeniably great) old school punk songs could be a bit hard to take for a newcomer. However, it is obviously a mandatory purchase for anarcho lovers. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Sealed Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Traumatizer Nuclear War Machine EP Since their self-titled debut from last year, I\u2019ve been a big fan of TRAUMATIZER\u2019s brutal brand of D-beat, and on their new EP Nuclear War Machine , they sound gnarlier than ever. Each of the five tracks here showcases their ability to seamlessly meld their influences into a streamlined sound that is entirely their own. Excellent riffs, excellent drumming, and excellent vocals, what more could you ask for? For fans of ANTI-CIMEX, SACRILEGE, and MOT\u00d6RHEAD, this one\u2019s a no-brainer. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Discos Enfermos Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Vor\u00e1gine P\u00e1nico EP VOR\u00c1GINE is Peruvian D-beat, punk crudo at its best. Primitivo in presentation and production, the P\u00e1nico EP will absolutely get your fist pumping. Seven tracks that contain bursts of Mot\u00f6r-punk forming bridges between noise-blasted lyrical delivery and everything happening at terminal velocity. If you\u2019re lacking in recent D-beat face-meltings, then you should probably check out VOR\u00c1GINE. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Discos Asalto / Little Jan's Hammer / Metadona / Tvmbalavalla Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Wavers Look What I Found LP The cyclical nature of music continues to resound as young folks renew and revise the spirit of \u201990s indie, centering bright hooks and big guitars. WAVERS, from Olympia where American indie has always thrived, sound familiar and novel at once, striking the perfect balance between the current crop of loftspace DIY rock and giants that came before\u2014even rhyming with early PAVEMENT in some of their guitar work. Vocalist/guitarist Rosie\u2019s soaring voice is smartly featured up front and center, bolstered by a smart and well-weathered backing band that knows what they like and how to play it. Drummer Charlie also sings sumptuous harmonies that will mist your eyes more than once, guaranteed. Totally gorgeous and self-assured emo-tinged indie that will ring true regardless what era it\u2019s heard in. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Reach Around / Salinas Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Xray Xeroxx Nevermind, Whatever cassette The forgotten Ramone was surely Eggy Ramone, no? XRAY XEROXX embodies the spirit of this made-up Ramone by giving us fourteen tracks of egged-up, RAMONES-meets-DEVO sugar rushes. While RAMONES and DEVO certainly get called to mind almost immediately, as the album goes on, those comparisons start to (d)evolve into something more like the QUEERS and the AQUABATS\u2014the immaturity of the lyrics, the performance/persona behind the music. These songs are definitely fun and snotty, but it does have me wondering if today\u2019s mainstream high schooler views this type of egg-punk in the same way a normie twenty years ago viewed REEL BIG FISH or the MAD CADDIES? Are lots of synth punks today just former marching band kids? Does SNOOPER sing along to MEPHISKAPHELES? Did PRISON AFFAIR perform in their high school musicals? Reviewer D. Gregory Label Robot Cannibal Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Aggravate Black Glass cassette Solid first offering from San Diego\u2019s AGGRAVATE. The band has one foot firmly planted in traditional USHC thanks to the straightforward vocals, but otherwise the proceedings are more atmospheric and heavier than your usual fare, almost approaching stadium crust. Overall not bad; I\u2019ll be curious to see what direction they go from here. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Human Future Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Bacarrudas Bleed Out, Get Pushed Off a Cliff, Sink to the Bottom of a Lake, and Play a Halloween Monster House Party! LP The title says it all, folks. A double LP full of campy, over-the-top, \u201960s-inspired monster madness straight out of Philadelphia. It\u2019s worthy of a seasonal spin during your next Pagan house party or seasonal sockhop. Songs like \u201cDracula\u2019s Castle\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s in Love with Frankenstein\u2019s Monster\u201d are loaded with all the reverb and tremolo of your fave \u201960s and \u201970s novelty records, and much to my enjoyment, they lean into the humor and campiness. It reminds me of the kind of stuff I would find in a used dollar bin and would scoop up without hesitation. It\u2019s pressed at 45 RPM on 12\u201d which adds to the novelty vibe. Overall, it\u2019s a fun record without a ton of memorable moments, but deserving of a listen if you\u2019re into the schtick. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Moms Basement / Schuylkill Beat Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Cold Summer Den Umst\u00e4nden Entsprechend 12\u2033 Good mix of post-punk and more classic punk rock\u2014their ability to go from the classically post-punk guitar in verses into a distorted explosion in the choruses was awesome. I really appreciated the noise and intensity that they kept up throughout, definitely a solid record. Reviewer Emma Miller Label It's Eleven Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Destiny Bond The Love LP Extremely solid effort that kicks into full gear immediately. Blistering guitar solos paired with a blood-curdling screamer and a tight, lightning-fast rhythm section. There\u2019s a little bit of keyboard action laced throughout that I wish was a bit more consistent and louder, but that\u2019s my only real complaint. Sounding a bit like their labelmates GUMM, DESTINY BOND also combines the best parts of youth crew hardcore (gang vocals and groovy, mosh-inducing tempos) with classic rock\u2019n\u2019roll mentality (charismatic singer, catchy riffs, and palpable energy). This is a great record and a fantastic addition to the Convulse library, which has hosted some real ten-out-of-ten albums over these last few years. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Convulse Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Electric Prawns 2 Heavy Shitters cassette Insanely catchy collection of garage punk tunes from Australia that was almost scrapped by the band? Folks, why? It\u2019s so good. If you like JAY REATARD or TEE VEE REPAIRMANN, give it a listen and soak in the rock\u2019n\u2019roll grit, the near-bubblegum vocals on tracks like \u201cMine Tonight\u201d (\u201cMake you mine toooo-niiiiiighttt\u201d), and the old school keys that bubble up like ? AND THE MYSTERIANS playing with the SPITS. Hooks hooking into more hooks on every song had me writing one word next to each song while listening: classic. Like the song \u201cBorned to Rock,\u201d ELECTRIC PRAWNS 2 were in fact borned to rock. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Forced Humility Burning Inside EP Burly, punishing hardcore that draws from the wellspring of \u201980s NYHC like the ABUSED or the MOB (the good stuff). Everything is outsized and menacing, with gang chants and guitar leads as you might expect, particularly if you\u2019ve encountered their demo from 2023. Sharing members with FORESEEN may also be a helpful bit of knowledge to have, another band to masterfully modernize old school influences. FORCED HUMILITY doesn\u2019t spare the hooks and isn\u2019t afraid to introduce a harmony, but make no mistake\u2014this shit is brutal and unsparing. An ass-beater, to be sure. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Heavy Lag / Sekunderna / Teenage Bigfoot / TV Cop split LP I love splits. This one is a cool showcase of the current dirt pop scene, with each band contributing two original songs and one cover. If that\u2019s not enough for you, it even comes with a fifteen-page zine. The whole affair gives off heavy MARKED MEN or RADIOACTIVITY vibes, so it should come as no surprise that three of the bands either recorded or mastered their tracks with Jeff Burke. The original songs are a good example of what each band brings to the table, but the covers are the real gems here. TV COP covering MOLLY HATCHET just might be my favorite track on the split; pop punks covering Southern rock and doing it justice??? I\u2019m into it. The TEENAGE BIGFOOT originals remind me of walking into a Hot Topic circa 2003. Not into it. On the other hand, their cover of \u201cDreams\u201d by the CRANBERRIES was stuck in my head for days, and I really dislike that band! For the uninitiated, I don\u2019t feel like anything on here will make any of these bands your new favorite. But for existing fans, Jeff Burke worshippers, or anyone looking for a few killer dirt pop covers, this LP will feel right at home in your collection. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Bloated Kat Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Imploders Targeted for Termination LP Static Shock delivers the second LP from IMPLODERS, a maddeningly fast, no-frills hardcore strike. Quick riffs, shredded vocals, constant energy\u2014tight and well-executed, but familiar. A solid, enjoyable record that stays in its lane. Ideal for listeners wanting straightforward speed and power. Static Shock trae el segundo LP de IMPLODERS, un ataque directo y enloquecedor de hardcore r\u00e1pido y sin aditivos. La banda ejecuta bien: riffs veloces, voces mordidas y energ\u00eda constante. Es s\u00f3lido y disfrutable, pero no sorprende ni rompe el molde. Hardcore bien hecho, ideal para quienes buscan velocidad pura. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Static Shock Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Jet! Everybody Plays the Game / Hear Me Sheila 7\u2033 reissue Until about five years ago, JET! was seemingly a complete unknown, nary a footnote in the annals of New Jersey power pop (which is actually New Jersey\u2019s top export as a state, not \u201cchemicals\u201d as the internet may try to make you believe). JET! formed in Toms River, cut two of the greatest power pop 45s ever, and disappeared. Luckily, a NJ collector uncovered a stack of deadstock copies of those two singles, and soon us obsessives got our grubby little hands on copies of our own. And now, the immaculate Fish & Cheap Records continue to do what they do best and get another obscure slab to the masses. \u201cEverybody Plays the Game\u201d and \u201cHere Me Sheila\u201d represent the band\u2019s second single, with the A-side being a little more driving than their first single \u201cPlease Mister Radio.\u201d While the decision to be a bit more rocking may have caused the rift in the band that led to their split, they still managed to capture lightning in a second bottle. If you have even a passing interest in punky power pop, all four of their songs are an absolute must, and Fish & Cheap are making it so the sounds aren\u2019t confined to the greasy collectors shelves. With any luck, they\u2019ll give the first release the reissue treatment as well. Get this, now. Reviewer D. Gregory Label Fish & Cheap Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Knowso Hypnotic Smack LP Cleveland duo KNOWSO, consisting of Nathan Ward (CRUELSTER, PERVERTS AGAIN, the CARP) and Jayson Gerycz (CLOUD NOTHINGS), return with Hypnotic Smack , a wiry, offbeat LP that fits neatly into the city\u2019s long tradition of bent punk weirdos. Earlier MRR reviewers have namedropped DEVO, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART, NOMEANSNO fronted by Steve Albini, and SERVOTRON when trying to pin this band down, and those touchpoints still make sense: jerky rhythms, odd vocal phrasing, and a nervous, sci-fi pulse that feels both mechanical and human. Must be something in the water in Cleveland, turning out band after band of weirdos who twist punk into performance art and still make it catchy. It\u2019s got humor, it\u2019s upbeat and angular, but it doesn\u2019t quite stick for me. All those reference points are ultimately more interesting than what comes through here. Maybe I\u2019m just wishing they\u2019d lean harder into it. The track \u201cSacred Mystery\u201d was a high point, a glimpse of the extra bite I wish the rest of the record had. In today\u2019s world, this isn\u2019t that weird or abrasive. Maybe it\u2019s a nonthreatening entry point for a voyage toward more esoteric pleasures. Eleven songs, thirty minutes. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Sorry State Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Lutheran Heat Hi Again LP Sophomore album of shambling, poppy indie punk from Minneapolis. They pull from multiple influences\u2014Motown, \u201960s pop, Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, Flying Nun Records, and contemporaries the BABIES\u2014in the same way Fred Thomas did with SATURDAY LOOKS GOOD TO ME. They nail that mix of scruffy punk attitude with melodic hooks the way that ex-BANANAS drummer Scott Miller did with his bands NAR and especially BRIGHT IDEAS. Reviewer Tim Janchar Label Pi\u00f1ata Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Mexoff / Negative Path split LP Jesus Christ, did they find enough labels to help release this thing? Classic fastcore powerviolence, but both bands sound different enough to keep things interesting. MEXOFF pulls double grunting vocal duties, sounding like MAN IS THE BASTARD and CAPTAIN THREE LEG with a very prominent, heavy bass. There\u2019s a bit of a crusty edge here as well. NEGATIVE PATH leans a little closer to the D-beat side of the spectrum and is a tad more guitar-heavy, with thrash-like solos and unique vocal tones; they sound like a pack of wild coyotes. There\u2019s over two dozen tracks piled onto this disc and none of them go over a minute-and-a-half. That\u2019s pure perfection right there. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Correctional Facility / Crapoulet / Drinkin' Beer in Bandana / Here And Now / Hecatombe / Loner Cult / Nothing to Harvest / Svab Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Morwan Vse Po Kolu, Znovu LP MORWAN began as a solo project by Alex Ashtaui in Kiev, Ukraine around 2019, but now MORWAN is a full band out of Berlin with Alex at the helm to guide the band into the darkest and heaviest post-punk territory ever to be explored. Their new album Vse Po Kolu, Znovu is an emotional journey through inspirations, ranging from things that sound like KILLING JOKE and MINISTRY to noisy psych rock \u00e0 la OH SEES. The guitar work on this album is really cool with its maximum-velocity plucking that is very surfy but also very rhythmic at times, and with its droning repetition, the sounds begin to distort in your mind as other influences emerge. This album would be perfect for a winter night while watching snow fall, especially the epic, nearly eight-minute closer \u201c\u041d\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0439\u201d as it enters a shoegaze/post-hardcore realm. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Feel It Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Neck Breather Set cassette Powerviolence is a micro-genre that strives at extremes, be it in velocity, tempo shifts, drama, or self-awareness. It became somewhat oversaturated some years ago with the rise in popularity of some bands, then went back \u201dunderground\u201d (it was never mainstream, but it used to be very niche), and only the strongest survived. NECK BREATHER is one of those cases\u2014some of the freshest-sounding modern powerviolence that I\u2019ve heard in a while, not the silly comedic powerviolence but the apocalyptic, nihilist kind like IRON LUNG. The sonic violence only gets amped up by the genius mastering by maniac James Plotkin (go check out OLD LADY DRIVERS or KHANATE if you\u2019re ready to die). Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 The Plane Crash Too Little Too Late EP The aspiration here is to make nostalgic, gritty rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but there\u2019s something charmingly off-kilter about the presentation that makes it more than just a pale shade of something we\u2019ve all heard before. Mark Death\u2019s vocals have that sort of monotone sociopathy to them, while the guitar has a direct-in compression that gives everything a sort of detachedness that manages to elevate the tightly-written material from \u201cJOHNNY THUNDERS knock-off\u201d to something much more odd and a hell of a lot of fun. There\u2019s a meager few tracks here to sink your teeth into, but the hand-hewn quality (see also: the horrorcore high school notebook cover art) makes it worth your time. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Hate Street Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Profit and Murder Doomed to Fail LP \u201cPROFIT AND MURDER? Are they still around? How long have they been playing? Since the 19th century?\u201d is likely to be the most common reaction to this brand new album, Doomed to Fail . It was certainly mine as I strongly, and perhaps irremediably, associate this German band with the \u201900s so that I am constantly surprised to hear about them. I hadn\u2019t listened to them in ages and only had a vague memory of what they were supposed to be about: rather typical old school crust punk. And to my great relief, Alzheimer\u2019s is still a long way off, because PROFIT AND MURDER plays precisely old school traditional crustcore, with two vocalists and something to say. Hurray! Despite being around since 2000, it seems that trends and fashion have had no effect whatsoever on the band\u2019s sound, impervious to change, which in this case is commendable in my opinion. Doomed to Fail can be said to be a trip down the \u201990s and early \u201900s Eurocrust memory lane, one I am happy to take, not out of nostalgia but because it\u2019s very well-done, with sincerity. Pummeling, fast, with a Scandi touch and a sense of confident simplicity that clicks. Bands like HIATUS, \u201900s VISIONS OF WAR, or 3-WAY CUM got invites of course, and PROFIT AND MURDER is one of the last instances of this peculiar species. I love that one. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Bomb-All / Uwaga \u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9 / Wild Wild East Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Regimiento Spansul Sorpresas en el Barro EP A short-lived unit out of early 1980s Valencia, REGIMIENTO SPANSUL left only the four tracks on this 7\u201d behind as evidence of their rowdy little run. The sounds here range from spirited first-wave inspiration (\u201cHaciendo Surf en Marte\u201d) to prickly and groovy post-punk (\u201cLa Ejecuci\u00f3n\u201d). If you\u2019ve been itching for some catchy and obscure Spanish nuggets, pick up this EP and consider yourself scratched. Reviewer Jason Harding Label El Mascarat / Prohibido Bailar / Zaragoza Desorden Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Shox Human Furniture cassette Wow. This is almost like perfect pop music. Vocals are soft, but assertive. The music itself is also soft, but with some excellent distortion. They marry remarkably well, which I suppose shouldn\u2019t really be a surprise, but it was noteworthy to me. The pace is measured and deliberate. Kind of reminds me of early BLUR or the DANDY WARHOLS. If you\u2019re familiar with the band GLITZ, that also comes to mind. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Quality Time Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Soga Corrosi\u00f3n LP Blistering punk from Mexico City masters SOGA. Their 2018 demo made a huge splash, ultimately making its way to vinyl thanks to the good folks at Iron Lung, so naturally their debut album has garnered a frenzy of excitement. No need to be coy here, it\u2019s fucking good. I think what sets SOGA apart is the curiosity they employ, pulling on threads that are woven into the broad tapestry of hardcore punk. At times they\u2019re unrelenting and ferocious, like on \u201cLa Respuest,\u201d and \u201cAniquilar.\u201d Without breaking character or missing a beat, they can flip a switch and delve into a catchy, \u201977-style rave-up like \u201cVoy Por Un Mai Camino.\u201d Gloriously genre-bending, pissed-off, political punk. Sign me the fuck up! Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Stranglehold Demo 2024 cassette Birmingham hardcore (with a capital H) born from the ashes of SUPPRESS. Massive-sounding hardcore in the vein of STRIFE (or, as they put it, \u201cbands that sound like they\u2019re straightedge but aren\u2019t\u201d), with mosh parts and melody standing side-by-side, and hyped-up sing-along queues. This is the type of hardcore that gets the blood boiling, or the dance moves in check. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Cruzade / Rest Assured / Warpath Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Ugly Stick Debut LP From Ohio in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, this is definitely my sort of thing, but they\u2019re brand new to me. It\u2019s definitely got a REPLACEMENTS feel to it. It\u2019s jangly and raw and has a good dash of country and folk going on. I gather from the liner notes and some online research that this is a reissue, but that\u2019s not a certainty for me. There\u2019s an honesty in this one that\u2019s compelling. It\u2019s also pretty well-done. It\u2019s catchy and melodic, gritty, and really both fun and cool to listen to. Other similarities\u2026what if you crossed the DILS with RANK AND FILE? And does anyone remember (IMPATIENT) YOUTH? Good shit. Reviewer Kenny Kaos Label Good Times Rock N Roll Club Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Winston Hytwr\u2019s Perfect Harmony Perfect Harmony cassette Buckle in for this Ohio-based adventure; an ever-meandering river of jangle pop/lo-fi bedroom pop/egg-punk/indie rock awaits on this seven-song cassette. As soon as you think you\u2019ve got the band figured out, WINSTON and co. throw you a curveball, leaving you guessing once more. The unexpected post-punk track \u201cSubject of Interest\u201d is unbelievably catchy and memorable, from its repetitive bass lines, noodly guitar leads, and impressively lackadaisically delivered vocals. It almost feels like the band is trying to play a slightly different sub-genre of the greater punk world with each track on this cassette. Perhaps this is being done to show us, the listener, that all of these sub-genres can in fact exist in Perfect Harmony . Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Clean Demon Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 V/A Chaos for Christmas CD This starts with a real heartbreaker of a seasonal song about not singing door-to-door because the singer is awfully sad about things and stuff (sad face emoji). I bet these songs were a real hoot to write (hoot emoji). The songs are mostly upbeat in sound but downbeat in jolliness, and are peppered with language that will get you on the \u201cnaughty list\u201d for certain (uh-oh emoji). My friend Derek loves Christmas-themed punk stuff so he can sprinkle in a few tunes he enjoys between the MARIAH CAREY and BING CROSBY family favorites Xmas playlist (thumbs up emoji), so at least one of these is already in a stocking in Michigan (shrug emoji). Reviewer Tony Party Label Rejected Youth Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 An Slua Sure Look It LP It\u2019s time to face an uncomfortable truth\u2014a lot of modern Oi! is complete and utter shite. It\u2019s either hardcore lite made by people in big shorts, or it\u2019s pop punk about the pub made by people in flat caps they bought off Amazon. It\u2019s bland, overproduced, insipid bollocks . So when I get the chance to listen to something truly good, not just \u201cgenre good\u201d but actually good, it\u2019s a real treat. AN SLUA is that treat. The Sligo skins have released a modern classic in their debut. Joining luminaries like OI POLLOI and the OPPRESSED in being fiercely political and not being afraid to nail their (correct) colours to the mast at a time when cowards are happy to be fencesitters, they also know their way around a tune. Catchy as fuck, lyrically whip-smart, and choruses that beg to be shouted on the terraces. This is, quite simply, class. Any time you don\u2019t bother listening to this is time wasted. Reviewer Ben Marshall Label Distroy / Longshot Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bad to Worse These Are Our Streets cassette One of those bands that isn\u2019t really sure what they want to sound like. Swapping between an amalgamation of HOT WATER MUSIC, O PIONEERS!, CRO-MAGS, and CHOKING VICTIM, the only consistent variable is the vocalist who maintains the same dynamic throughout the entire record. While the stamina is impressive, the lack of vocal nuance is a tad dry. The gang vocals laden throughout sound great and pepper in a much needed charisma boost. A release where everyone involved is obviously quite talented, but it all sounds a bit dated. The whole orgcore motif combining the posi-tough-guy image with the sentimental longing for \u201chome\u201d was fresh fifteen years ago but still hasn\u2019t hit its nostalgia period, it just sounds stale. However, if you still pine for that era, then you\u2019ll love this. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Beta Maximo \u00daltimo Asalto cassette As is more often than not the case, Knuckles on Stun brings us yet another absolute smash hit! BETA MAXIMO is a wildly prolific garage punk band from Spain with more releases than some bands have songs. Eight catchy and driving tracks, most of which are pushed over the top by having almost sickeningly poppy synth licks. I absolutely love this! I truly hope that my Spanish not being very good might mean there is a chance that \u00daltimo Asalto is not the band\u2019s way of telling us that this is their final release. If that is the case, then I really hope I am of the lucky 25 people to get a copy of the forthcoming BETA MAXIMO discography cassette on Knuckles on Stun, as that is the standard amount that label makes of each of their releases (this one included), so get one while you can. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #510 \u2022 November 2025 Bezette Stad F.A.N.O.N. 12\u2033 Belgian hardcore band BEZETTE STAD has been releasing music for about five years now. Their latest release F.A.N.O.N. is a six-song 12\u2033 that explores our contemporary global scenario with articulate hardcore blended with D-beat, as if PAINT IT BLACK started hanging out with DISCHARGE. From the bass-heavy opener of \u201cReform\u201d to the metallic pummeling and digital glitching in closer \u201c28 Days\u201d the F.A.N.O.N. 12\u2033 is six slices of hardcore hellion heaven, and you need to put it in your ear holes posthaste.

Wednesday Knudsen :: Atrium Posted on December 2, 2025 November 29, 2025 An immersive double LP of woodsy ambient from upstate New York. You may recognize Wednesday Knudsen\u2019s name from her various collaborative projects \u2014 Pigeons, Stella Kola, Weeping Bong Band, a killer duo LP with Willy Lane, and probably many more. But Atrium is a true solo project, with Knudsen layering sax, synth, guitar, flute and autoharp to create a rich and spacious landscape worthy of such masters as Joanna Brouk, Laraaji and Iasos, alongside the Japanese environmental music tradition. Totem Pocket :: Chump Posted on December 2, 2025 November 30, 2025 The latest offering from Denver\u2019s Totem Pocket begins with its wooziest, weirdest song, a bad trip translated into thick, sludgy sound. Stick with it though! You\u2019ll be rewarded with a truly awesome slab of fuzzy and fierce dream pop.

Videodrome :: Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003) Posted on December 1, 2025 November 30, 2025 Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003) is an affecting meditation on the theatrical experience, exploring the nuances of film exhibition and the paradoxical loneliness of experiencing cinema in a darkened room amongst strangers \u2014 all together, yet still alone. It\u2019s a bittersweet love letter to the vagabond souls who seek solace in theaters, who relish in the ceremonial comforts of getting popcorn, settling into their seats, and waiting for the house lights to dim. This is a movie that not only loves movies, but also postulates that such love comes from going to see a movie in a theater , the experiential factor as significant on one\u2019s own thoughts, feelings, or understanding of a film as the film itself. The Quiet Revolution: Talk Talk\u2019s Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock Posted on November 28, 2025 November 25, 2025 Some records feel impossible to write about. Not because they lack substance, but because they possess too much of it: too much quiet, too much space, too much mystery. They resist language the way water resists a net. Talk Talk\u2019s Spirit of Eden (1988) and Laughing Stock (1991) feel like works designed to escape description altogether. And perhaps the paradox is this: the quieter the music becomes, the more words people spend trying to grasp it. Silence invites interpretation; these albums invite entire libraries. Approaching them feels like stepping barefoot into a dark, vast hall \u2013 your perception sharpened, your breath suddenly audible. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on November 26, 2025 November 24, 2025 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Zachary Cale :: Love\u2019s Work Posted on November 26, 2025 November 25, 2025 A year ago, Brooklyn songwriter Zachary Cale took a break from routine and made an album entirely on piano. Now Cale is back to his primary instrument, the guitar, in a new collection of songs that bridge the difference between Glenn Jones-style finger-picking and expansive, nearly new age-y instrumental music a la Yasmin Williams. Transmissions :: Steve Von Till Posted on November 26, 2025 December 1, 2025 Welcome back to Transmissions. This week: Steve Von Till, of sludge legends Neurosis, the tribal ambient spin-off Tribes of Neurot, solo albums under this own name, and the psych folk project Harvestman. He runs the independent label, Neurot Recordings. And as if all that isn\u2019t enough, he\u2019s also a poet, and an educator\u2014when he\u2019s not playing music, he\u2019s bringing knowledge to the next generation, working as a fourth grade teacher in North Idaho. Snocaps :: S/T Posted on November 25, 2025 November 25, 2025 There\u2019s a real pleasure in hearing genetically linked voices singing together, as the individual ticks and characteristics meld in a single, dizzying tone, and especially these two with their burred Americana grace. Add to that the multifarious contributions of MJ Lenderman, playing drums, bass, electric guitar and 12-string, and Megafaun\u2019s Brad Cook (bass, drums, recording and engineering), and you get an extraordinary debut record, wry and self-lacerating in parts and kick-down-the-amps rowdy in others. Wouter Dewit :: Still Posted on November 25, 2025 November 24, 2025 Via Hasselt, Belgium. These fleeting weeks between Halloween and Christmas, when the polyester cobwebs on the front porch are swapped out for tinsel garland, have no time to stake out their own identity. They\u2019re forever lost in transit from one holiday to the next. But during these ephemeral days between \u201cThe Monster Mash\u201d and \u201cSilver Bells,\u201d an album like Wouter Dewit\u2019s Still (2017) finds its place, mirroring the shift in seasons \u2014and in ourselves\u2014with bittersweet introspection. Dollar Diamonds :: Volume Three Posted on November 24, 2025 November 24, 2025 There\u2019s a lot of great records out there that can still be had for very little money. You just have to crouch down and give them a chance. How is it possible that these 2-sided slices of the human spirit can exist among us, in some cases, for over 50 years and still only be $1? Welcome to Dollar Diamonds, Volume 3. This month: Jesse Winchester, Eric Andersen, Neil Diamond, Doug Kershaw, Graham Parker, Tom T. Hall, and Robert Palmer\u2026 Paul McCartney & Wings :: Loup (1st Indian On The Moon) Posted on November 24, 2025 November 23, 2025 With a new oral history providing fascinating context on the self-proclaimed \u201cmadcap\u201d formation and career of Wings (a good chunk of which comes from Paul McCartney himself), spacey instrumental \u201cLoup (1st Indian On The Moon)\u201d has proven worthy of a closer listen. The deep cut oddity from 1973\u2019s oft-maligned Red Rose Speedway is an experimental studio piece featuring Minimoog synthesizer and plays out like a mini-prog opus, a little reminiscent of a Pink Floyd soundtrack cut. \u201cHard to explain\u201d, in the musician\u2019s own assessment.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
