        <ul class="review">
            <li><b>The Mountain Goats - Through This Fire Across From Peter Balkan</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The Mountain Goats are a critically acclaimed indie folk/rock act whose style aligns well with artists like Wilco and Jason Isbell, fitting your criteria for folk/americana and artistic merit, even without a specific review.</i></span></li><li><b>Makaya McCraven - Off the Record</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Makaya McCraven is an innovative jazz artist known for pushing boundaries and blending genres. This fits your criteria for artistic value within occasionally accepted genres like jazz, warranting a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Nine Inch Nails - TRON: Ares Soundtrack</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: From a favorite artist, and the description 'invokes the past and the future' suggests artistic depth. However, 'electronic riches' and 'soundtrack' could potentially lean towards highly processed or functional music, so it requires manual review to ensure it meets your specific criteria for artistic value over function.</i></span></li><li><b>Destiny Bond - The Love</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: This hardcore release is described with 'blistering guitar solos,' 'blood-curdling screamer,' and 'lightning-fast rhythm section,' suggesting high intensity. Its combination of youth crew hardcore with 'classic rock’n’roll mentality' hints at a unique fusion, but also uses generic praise like 'extremely solid' and 'great record'.</i></span></li><li><b>Zachary Cale - Love’s Work</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 78]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Describes a collection of songs that 'bridge the difference between Glenn Jones-style finger-picking and expansive, nearly new age-y instrumental music a la Yasmin Williams.' The emphasis on intricate guitar work and artistic exploration, akin to folk and Americana artists you appreciate, suggests artistic merit. The 'new age-y' aspect requires manual review to ensure it avoids functional background music.</i></span></li><li><b>The Replacements - Let It Be</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: While there's no specific review text, The Replacements are a legendary alternative rock band, a strong stylistic match for your punk/alternative taste. This is a deluxe edition of a foundational album, warranting a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Oneohtrix Point Never - Tranquilizer</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Oneohtrix Point Never is an acclaimed experimental electronic artist known for innovative and challenging work. This aligns with your interest in artistic value and experimental music, making it worth a manual review despite no explicit description.</i></span></li><li><b>Spear of Conquest - Summoning Hellgates</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as 'dark and aggressive' and a 'fiery joy ride downward into Hell', which hints at relevant extreme metal. While some praise is generic, the core descriptors align with your taste for intense and impactful music.</i></span></li><li><b>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy - HEAVY</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The album title 'HEAVY' aligns with your preferred extreme metal/sludge genres, and the review comes from a 'Heavy Blog is Heavy' context, suggesting a strong genre fit. However, the description is minimal, warranting a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Cold Summer - Den Umständen Entsprechend</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: A good mix of post-punk and classic punk rock with 'distorted explosion' and 'noise and intensity' are positive indicators for artistic value and a non-generic sound. It's described as 'solid' which is generic praise, but the genre and sonic descriptors are promising.</i></span></li><li><b>Shox - Human Furniture</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: Described as 'almost like perfect pop music' but with 'excellent distortion,' 'soft, but assertive' vocals, and a 'measured and deliberate' pace. References to early BLUR or THE DANDY WARHOLS suggest an alternative rock sound with artistic tension between pop sensibilities and distortion, hinting at unique artistic value.</i></span></li><li><b>Rolo Tomassi - Astrea</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 75]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: As a previous album by Rolo Tomassi, it's mentioned as mixing their 'two-faceness evenly across songs.' While less detailed than the description for 'Grievances,' the mention of the artist's characteristic blend of styles suggests potential artistic merit and complexity, which aligns with your taste for innovative rock and metal. Given the strength of 'Grievances', this is worth a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Pitchblack - Walking On Burning Ground</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 72]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: An 'interesting blend of Death and Groove Metal with some Thrash Metal twists' makes this a genre match. While 'interesting blend' is somewhat generic, the combination of aggressive metal subgenres suggests potential for a relevant and engaging listen.</i></span></li><li><b>Regimiento Spansul - Sorpresas en el Barro</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 72]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: This EP features sounds ranging from 'spirited first-wave inspiration' to 'prickly and groovy post-punk.' The 'prickly' descriptor and post-punk genre align with your interests, suggesting some artistic edge, but the description is not extensive enough to guarantee high priority.</i></span></li><li><b>Stråle - Reformatiom</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The description 'unpolished polished-ness' is an intriguing, contradictory phrase that suggests a unique fusion or artistic challenge, which can align with your criteria. However, its brevity necessitates a manual review.</i></span></li><li><b>Aggravate - Black Glass</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: The description highlights traditional USHC with 'atmospheric and heavier' elements, almost 'stadium crust,' which hints at depth beyond typical hardcore. However, it's tempered by 'solid' and 'not bad' which are generic.</i></span></li><li><b>Stranglehold - Demo 2024</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: This is 'Birmingham hardcore (with a capital H)' described as 'massive-sounding' and in the vein of STRIFE, with 'mosh parts and melody standing side-by-side.' While indicating strong, energetic hardcore, the description doesn't deeply elaborate on artistic innovation or emotional depth beyond 'gets the blood boiling'.</i></span></li><li><b>Joropop - Psych Pop & Folk in Venezuela, 1968-1976</b> <span class='score'>[AI Score: 70]</span><br><span class='reasoning'>&nbsp;&nbsp;↳ <i>AI Reason: A compilation described as 'Psych Pop & Folk,' which aligns with your occasional interest in folk and various subgenres of rock. While the description is somewhat generic, the genre itself is relevant.</i></span></li>
