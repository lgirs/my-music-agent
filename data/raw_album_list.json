Electronic / Experimental PLAGUE MUSIC EP KAVARI A noise artist who once found hidden music in the crackle of fire sounds equally incendiary on her latest EP of club music, sculpting redlining rhythms out of blocks of charred bass. Experimental Rosacea Gaute Granli The Norwegian artist\u2019s loop-based assemblages follow a strange, dreamlike logic, weaving indecipherable vocals and stray bits of texture into warped avant-pop. Electronic Shadow Language Brendon Moeller The South African artist emphasizes atmosphere over rhythm on a vibrant, textural album that shapeshifts between drum\u2019n\u2019bass and dub techno. Experimental URGH Mandy, Indiana Best New Album The noise-rock band\u2019s second album is a breakthrough: insidiously catchy, incomprehensibly groovy, and fueled by righteous fury. See More More Reviews Experimental Tranquilizer Oneohtrix Point Never Best New Album Drawing on a cache of commercial sample CDs, Daniel Lopatin assembles an impossibly dense and transportive electronic album that takes impermanence as its inspiration.

Rock Snocaps Snocaps The Crutchfield twins\u2014accompanied by MJ Lenderman and Brad Cook\u2014reunite for a spirited new project that plays to their strengths and embraces all the miles they\u2019ve traveled. Pop/R&B LUX Rosal\u00eda Best New Album The Spanish singer\u2019s fourth record is a heartfelt offering of avant-garde classical pop that roars through genre, romance, and religion. Rap Stardust Danny Brown Working with a new vanguard of outsider electronic artists, the Detroit rapper lets his freak flag fry. The results are shaky but full of heart. Pop/R&B West End Girl Lily Allen With an album that doubles as an insider\u2019s account of a tabloid divorce, the singer finds a new evolution of her signature style: Lightness isn\u2019t a foil for irony, but a vehicle for hurt. Rap Lil Herb G Herbo Stepping into his teenage shoes for a loose concept album, the Chicago icon reflects on the original era of drill with the clarity of a scene veteran. Electronic Repulsor Shlohmo The L.A. beatmaker turns aggressive on his fourth album\u2014dialing up the distortion, flooding his beats with overdriven synths, and pushing anxious moods into the red.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37425 Reviews Quan tot s'apagui Syberia I have always maintained that instrumental music is harder to write and listen to, because vocals and lyrics aren\u2019t here to guide your way. SYBERIA are masters at creating landscapes that you have never seen before\u2026never experienced before. It\u2019s like a trip through every corner of the universe with your eyes closed and only your imagination guides the way. T\u00e9km\u00e9s Juodvarnis This was a fantastic release, and I don\u2019t believe I have ever heard a band from Lithuania before. The secret to their sound was combining aggressiveness and torture with atmosphere, ambiance, and melody. There were just enough Progressive elements (odd chord progressions, technical prowess, etc.) to keep the sound modern and interesting, and I would love to hear what the band does next. Zombie Chronicles Vol. 1 Season of the Dead Booriingg Many Will Never Know This Freedom Skyclad Cult This EP is so endearing. Reliance Soen SOEN shows no signs of slowing down on \u201cReliance.\u201d The songs are a bit more concise in terms of their length, but it\u2019s the emotional impact that will sweep you off your feet. Primordial What Will Be I have to say that even though this isn\u2019t even close to my cup of tea, there is no denying that WHAT WILL BE exists of four very good musicians who really gel well together. They know how to complement each other in such a way that it makes the songs sound very good indeed. Decomposition Pythonic PYTHONIC does command respect. The way they have approached the music is impressive. I hear Metalcore, I get Metal Hardcore, I receive Groove metal and I hear Heavy Metal. Sometimes one of the four, at other times two or more of the four ingredients on offer. And what is even more impressive; they work well together. Inner Keep Mother Crone There is no way in Heaven or Hell that I can\u2019t NOT like what MOTHER CRONE is offering me on \u201cInner Keep\u201d, as the songs are all of a very high standard, have all the right ingredients to sound amazing. Proper introductions, solid foundations, hard edged bodies and fitting endings. Guerre Et Paix Via Doloris Overall, this was a good album. It wasn\u2019t too aggressive or dark, and you could also clearly hear some nice bass work. I also found it to be as advertised\u2026leading melodies with Folk echoes, and they did show restraint in the album. Obsidian Cult Hollow Peak Norse heavy metal band\u00a0Hollow Peak\u00a0released their debut LP\u00a0Obsidian Cult\u00a0on January 23, 2026. This album impressed [\u2026] Thou Hast Done Nothing Nornes French doom/death metal band\u00a0Nornes\u00a0released their newest album\u00a0Thou Hast Done Nothing\u00a0on December 2, 2025. It's an [\u2026] Planned Obsolescence Only Human This was an outstanding Progressive album, and in many ways, it might point towards where the genre is headed for the future. The band has some serious chops, but they don\u2019t overtake the sound, which is heavily focused on an emotional impact. It kept moving forward\u2026branching out, exploring, uncovering rocks that used to be a permanent part of the scene, and each transition was completely smooth. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Same Drug New High Gluecifer I don\u2019t care what your status is emotionally, if \u201cSame Drug New High\u201d doesn\u2019t make you feel better than I haven\u2019t got a clue what will. I know that every time I listen to this GLUECIFER album I get a big smile on my face, start tapping my foot and nodding my head. Welcome back!! Apocalypse Inc Frozen Factory The eclectic mix of styles and musical directions actually works on \u201cApocalypse Inc\u201d, the fourth album by FROZEN FACTORY. Somehow, they have adopted the ability to make all the different angles come together in a way that the blending is almost unnoticeable, but still very much present when you really take a listen. Equinox Equilibrium When I saw this on the to do list of METAL TEMPLE, the combination of musical styles had me intrigued. That is why I requested this review as mine. I like some Metalcore, just as I love some Folk Metal, but they have to get it right to get me really going. The question that I will be asking myself here is whether EQULIBRIUM has the ability to mix them in such a way that it will blow me away. Ready To Fight Cremate \u201cReady to Fight\u201d is the rebirth of CREMATE, a band forged in the Athens underground of the early 90s. Built on the foundation of their cult demo \u201cEnd of Time\u201d (1993), this EP reimagines the raw Death/Thrash spirit of the past with a modern twist weaving in dark synths, samples, and atmospheric textures without losing any of the aggression. Killerdemons Borrower BORROWER and their record companies Octopus Rising / Argonauta Records state on the EPK that they play Progressive Metal, and I\u2019ll admit that this genre is part of their sound, but I need to add a bit of Alternative Rock, a bit of Sludge and a smidgeon of Industrial as well. Qroba Ennui Overall, the best part of the album was trying to decide if it was nearly void of all emotion, or bursting alive with it, and that depends on the listener\u2019s perspective. It was composed in a way that it could go either direction. Latest Interviews All 2132 Interviews Markus Lachendro Xfactor1 I took some time recently and sat down with Markus Lachendro, guitarist for the band [\u2026] Micha\u0142 Chro\u015bcielewski, Pawe\u0142 Smarkusz, Monika Chro\u015bcielewska CZART CZART is an experimental metal band hailing from Poland. The concept behind their debut album, \u201cCzarty Polskie,\u201d has been controversial not only for the AI debate but for the many references to Polish demonology. On All Hallows Eve, Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with members of CZART to discuss everything from AI to the reasons why metal resonates so much in Poland to whether we are living in the best of times or the worst. Most importantly, they discuss the beloved CZART goat. Sam Graff Agenbite Misery AGENBITE MISERY hails from New Hampshire. In February 2026, the band will be releasing their debut album, \"Remorse of Conscience.\" The album is an experimental metal interpretation of \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce.

Stefano Fiorelli Warcoe WARCOE hails from Pesaro, Italy. Formed in 2021, following the year of our plague, the Doom trio has been blazing a trail through the Italian Doom scene with one monumental album after the other. On September 26, 2025 they released their third full-length album, \u201cUpon Tall Thrones,\u201d which not only weighed in at 8/10 on the Metal Temple scales but hit #1 on Doom Charts for September 2025. This month Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, was able to catch up with Stefano Fiorelli (guitars, vocals) to discuss the origin story of WARCOE, details of their latest album, and even speculate on the impacts of AI and streaming platforms. Jacob Curwen All Hell All Hell has been described as a Blackened Thrash band, but they are much more. On October 10, 2025, the trio for Ashville, North Carolina release their fifth full-length album, \"Sunsetter,\" via Terminus Hate City. Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with Jacob Curwen (vocals, guitars) to discuss topics ranging from the band's origins to the details of \"Sunsetter\" to AI in metal.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Dyed in Grey \u2013 Harbinger Review By ClarkKent on February 5, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Progressive Metal , 18 comments \u201cFor progressive death metal acts, the shadow of the masters, Opeth looms large. Yet some recent progressive death acts, like Iotunn , T\u00c3\u00b3mar\u00c3\u00bam , and Dvne , have carved their own paths in the genre. When Dyed in Grey released their debut, The Abandoned Part , in 2013, Opeth was charting a course into pure prog sans death metal. I only mention Opeth because Dyed in Grey \u2019s brand of prog death sees clear influences in the titans of the genre, though with a more technical, improvisational imprint.\u201d Grey and fancy. Agenbite Misery \u2013 Remorse of Conscience Review By Andy-War-Hall on February 5, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Noise Rock , Post-Metal , Sludge Metal , 47 comments \u201cAnyone who\u2019s brushed against James Joyce\u2019s modernist classic Ulysses has almost certainly encountered the phrase \u201cremorse of conscience\u201d before. A pivotal theme of the novel, remorse of conscience refers to more than mere guilt over a perceived ethical failure but the misery inflicted by it, its weight and torment. In the days leading up to receiving Remorse of Conscience , the independent debut from New Hampshire\u2019s genre-blending Agenbite Misery , a record informed by Ulysses and \u201csteeped in grief, alienation and the search for meaning in modern life,\u201d I was experiencing that eponymous turmoil myself.\u201d Modern Hellenic disorientation. Tarlung \u2013 Axis Mundi Review By Tyme on February 5, 2026 in Reviews , Doom Metal , Sludge Metal , 22 comments \u201cVienna, Austria\u2019s Tarlung has been coughing up thick clouds of resinous doom and smoky sludge since 2013, when, after just six months in existence and having never performed live, they released their eponymous debut album. Now, with two additional full-lengths\u00e2\u0080\u00942017\u2019s Beyond the Black Pyramid and 2021\u2019s Architect \u00e2\u0080\u0094and some healthy touring under their belts, Tarlung braces to bring their fourth album in nearly five years, Axis Mundi , to the masses.\u201d Coughing up the goods. Course of Fate \u2013 Behind the Eclipse Review By Twelve on February 4, 2026 in Reviews , Progressive Metal , 19 comments \u201cAfter waiting seventeen years to release their debut full-length, Norwegian progressive metal act Course of Fate is now three albums in since 2020. I missed their sophomore release in 2023\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u2019m actually just learning it exists as I type this\u00e2\u0080\u0094so I was especially excited to see this group back in action. Mindweaver was a delight of an album, the kind of release that hums with potential and makes you eager to see what a band is going to do next.\u201d Progressive futures. Mayhem \u2013 Liturgy of Death Review By Grin Reaper on February 4, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 66 comments \u201c Mayhem \u2019s reputation will forever be linked to their early days, inescapably tethered to the chaos of death. While it\u2019s impossible not to acknowledge those grisly events when considering the band\u2019s legacy, they detract from the unyielding musical vision Mayhem has etched into metal mythology. From the beginning, Mayhem has been at the forefront as one of black metal\u2019s tastemakers and breath-takers. Over four decades in, Mayhem returns with Liturgy of Death \u00e2\u0080\u0094a fitting subject considering the band\u2019s sordid origins and their penchant for metaphysical musings.\u201d Never ending mayheming. Diespnea \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Radici Review By Kronos on February 4, 2026 in Avante Garde , Black Metal , Code666 Records , Italian Metal , Releases , Reviews , Black Metal , 35 comments \u201cA black metal album bent on re-orienting the genre away from a frostbitten North and towards an imaginary sun-bleached South, the saguaro being perhaps the most resilient (and, tellingly, clich\u00c3\u00a9d) symbol thereof. Ambitions often crumble against this landscape; the schemes of miners fall through, the hopeful homesteads dry into rubble, at the bodies of desperate migrants collapse in the canyons. Beauty and hostility, available in such great measure here, produce the romance of the desert, the basis for Radici .\u201d Like a cactus in the snow. Lord of the Lost \u2013 Opvs Noir Vol 2 Review By ClarkKent on February 3, 2026 in Reviews , Gothic Metal , Industrial Metal , Pop Metal , Symphonic Metal , 23 comments \u201cLittle did I realize when Napalm announced that Lord of the Lost was recording a 33-song trilogy that each album would release so close to one another. A mere four months following the release of Opvs Noir Vol 1 , we get Opvs Noir Vol 2 , and it\u2019s just in time for stocking stuffer season. Vol 1 was my introduction to this one-time Eurovision finalist, and I came away impressed. So I was pretty excited to see this in the doldrums of our December promo bin. With the quick release of Vol 2 , I can only assume Lord of the Lost wrote all 33 songs of the trilogy together, Lord of the Rings -style.\u201d Lots of lost. Rave in Fire \u2013 Square One Review By Holdeneye on February 3, 2026 in Reviews , Hard Rock , Heavy Metal , 52 comments \u201cThe 80s feel like my own personal primordial, mythological paradise, a Garden of Eden to which I can never return. The gate is eternally guarded by a cherub wielding a flaming sword, but thanks to bands like Rave in Fire , I need not risk being divinely smote in order to feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m back in the garden, all innocent, naked, and happy.\u201d Naked in the rave garden. Backengrillen \u2013 Backengrillen Review By Tyme on February 3, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Punk , 27 comments \u201cAs this new year has gotten off to a right proper, lunacy-fueled start, I scoured the sump pit in search of something to pen my first review of 2026 on. As I poked through the pickens, slim as they were, I spied one of my favorite tags: \u2018 Steel says review,\u2019 sitting unclaimed. Self-described as \u2018free form death-jazz,\u2019 Ume\u00c3\u00a5, Sweden\u2019s Backengrillen play music that is a paean to chaos and destruction. The basic idea is to take a death/doom metal, or noiserock riff and play it until it loses meaning and then break it apart like a ravenous cat would a tiny forest mouse. Okay, I thought, I\u2019ll bite.\u201d Business in the front, grillen in the back. Defaced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Icon Review By Kronos on February 2, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 45 comments \u201c Icon , the third record form Switzerland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Defaced , comes wrapped up in a characteristically Olofsson-ey work and, much like the cover, is decidedly human, if a bit unambitious. Defaced have re-emerged more than a decade for good reason; a record\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of carefully-crafted death metal.\u201d Re-Defaced.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Destroyer :: Destroyer's Rubies Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together In 1976 the granola jazzists teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in the sphere, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Videodrome :: Safe (1995) Posted on February 5, 2026 February 5, 2026 Safe has been called a psychological drama, a social satire, an allegory of the 1980s AIDS crisis, and a meditation on American culture in a post-industrial landscape. More than thirty years after its release, the film\u2019s peculiar themes remain open to interpretation, continuing to invite discussion and debate. Silvia Tarozzi :: Lucciole Posted on February 5, 2026 February 4, 2026 Lucciole , the latest album from Italian violinist, composer, vocalist, and improviser Silvia Tarozzi, unfolds like a strange existential drama. A richly layered work in every sense\u2014sonically, compositionally, thematically\u2014it seemingly traces the arc of a life in surrealist form while blending chamber folk, classical, and avant-garde sounds. Tarozzi immerses her voice in an environment of strings, horns, guitars, keys, theremin, zither, and sound manipulation, creating something that feels breathtaking alive \u2014 the music is radiant, luminous like its namesake. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on February 4, 2026 February 3, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Doopees :: Doopee Time Posted on February 4, 2026 February 4, 2026 An oddity on just about every front, 1995\u2019s Doopee Time is a fictional universe crafted by Japanese composer and steelpan drum maestro Yann Tomita. From the depths of Tomita\u2019s Audio Science Laboratory, the narrative-based concept album (featuring vocals and spoken vignettes by Buffalo Daughter\u2019s Yumiko Ohno) straddles a retro-futuristic line of sparkling art pop originals and innovative, genre-bending covers from the likes of The Ronettes to Pet Sounds closer \u201cCaroline, No\u201d. Touching on that Spector production, musique concr\u00e8te, cosmic jazz and a healthy dose of John Cage composition, Yann Tomita\u2019s conceptual vision of the fictitious Doopees is one not to be missed (even stretched out over seventy three minutes). Bandcamping :: Winter 2026 Posted on February 4, 2026 February 3, 2026 With the latest Bandcamp Friday hitting on Feb. 6, the time is right to melt the ice of winter 2026 with some fresh and far out sounds. Discover some recent/recommended tunes below. Shintaro Noguchi & The Roadhouse Band. Nailah Hunter & Alia. Zander Raymond. Hans Chew, Old Saw. Jessica Williams. Jake Xerxes Fussell & James Elkington. The Far Sound. Malombo. Joe Harvey-Whyte & Paul Cousins. Muriel Grossmann :: Plays the Music of McCoy Tyner and the Grateful Dead Posted on February 3, 2026 February 3, 2026 On a four-track double album, Austrian saxophonist Muriel Grossmann pays tribute to the music of two American visionaries: McCoy Tyner and Bob Weir. Though the music of the jazz pianist and Grateful Dead guitarist would not seem to have much in common, Grossmann\u2019s festive, idiosyncratic renditions suggest some intriguing links. With an ear for robust melody and an open-ended approach, Grossmann has created a moving tribute that suggests the only true way to carry on is to transform. Have You Heard About the World Coming to an End? Posted on February 3, 2026 February 2, 2026 Released just before Christmas by London\u2019s Death is Not the End label, Have You Heard About the World Coming to an End? is a most welcome compilation of gospel choirs and harmony groups recorded between the late 1920s and mid 1950s. It\u2019s marvelous stuff\u2014raw and scruffy and spirited and cool. The Clean :: Mister Pop Posted on February 2, 2026 February 2, 2026 While consistency was always a calling card for legendary New Zealand band The Clean, their final record Mister Pop deserves a spot in the pantheon of all-time excellent swan song records. While never feeling a departure from the band\u2019s signature guitar pop sound, the record plays out like a swirling homage to the titan influences of the past: from the pure jangly nod to Rubber Soul and Ray Davies playbook to Velvets guitar drones and a pure krautrock experiment. On the eve of a recently announced definitive book on the band and following the tragic passing of the late Hamish Kilgour, the now seventeen-year old record provides a deeply fascinating revisit. Adam Bhala Lough on Deepfaking Sam Altman Posted on February 2, 2026 February 2, 2026 Adam Bhala Lough has made films about capricious characters. See his 2008 film The Upsetter: The Life & Music of \u201cLee\u201d Scratch Perry , or his 2009 film about Lil Wayne, The Carter , or his 2023 HBO series Telemarketers , about the underbelly of the telemarketing industry. But his new film, Deepfaking Sam Altman , is his most experimental and unusual project yet. Aquarium Drunkard caught up with Bhala Lough to discuss the movie, AI\u2019s potential and drawbacks, and why at the end of the day, we replace our humanity with efficient machinery at our own peril. Big Sky Documentary Film Festival 2026 Posted on January 29, 2026 January 29, 2026 We are heading to Missoula, MT next month. Excited to announce\u00a0that Aquarium Drunkard has curated the music portion of the 2026 Big Sky Documentary Film Festival happening\u00a0between February 13-22.\u00a0Seven music docs, new and vintage. Justin will be on site first weekend. Featuring:\u00a0Sun Ra: Do the Impossible.\u00a0Speed Racer: Welcome to the World of Vic Chesnutt. Little Feat: The\u00a0Documentary. Summer Tour. Chet Baker: Let\u2019s Get Lost. Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together. Benjamin Smoke. Donald Byrd :: Ethiopian Knights Posted on January 29, 2026 January 27, 2026 After a decade under Van Gelder\u2019s roof, Donald Byrd decamps for sun-kissed LA to record Ethiopian Knights , an album that rests comfortably in the improvisational sweet spot where Mwandishi and Peter Green\u2019s End of the Game converge; acknowledging the gravitational pull of early 70s jazz funk but reveling in the turf that lies at its edge. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on January 28, 2026 January 27, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Fabiano Do Nascimento & Vittor Santos Orchestra :: Vila Posted on January 28, 2026 January 27, 2026 Vila , the new symphonic samba jazz album by prolific Brazilian guitarist Fabiano do Nascimento, feels like both his most intimate and his most grandiose, as he tries to keep the idyllic minimalism of his style of acoustic guitar while striving for the expressive radiance of 1960s noir film scores. Nascimento, now a fixture of the Los Angeles jazz scene, wanted the record to pay tribute to the street he grew up in Rio, an enclosed alleyway in the old neighborhood of Catete . .

Reminder for self at end of year when going backwards for year-end purposes: This is a review for a 2025 release. I find myself musing on this constantly , if not just because it serves as a suitable cattle-prod to the brain to lure me from my \u201ccatch up on a whole year\u2019s worth of sleep in two-weeks\u201d stupor that the post-holiday season seems to have lulled me into. It is interesting that the first few releases of the year always find themselves entangled with a demented form of catch-up from the previous year. Time being the non-infinite resource from a mortal standpoint, it has not allowed us to cover the myriad things we wish to write about. There will always be one more, one late discovery, and often we invent excuses to continue looking backwards because a signal cast off into space still exists in some form of radio wave. We quest to find it and ackowledge it, and so the tail end of one year hangs on like the most stubborn bastard out there, refusing to let us continue forward into the next series of unending car-crashes that we adoringly refer to as our favored musical genre. We also, as a result, have compulsions and imagined debts that must be repaid and a mused-over line in a year-end list quickly becomes a one-way directive of something owed, whether a band is aware of it or not. Thus, it was promised that we would dive into Black Rabbit\u2019s December-released EP Warren Of Necrosis and goddamnit here we are, only two months later \u2013 as opposed to say five or ten as our previous records have been \u2013 looking at the continuation of the death and thrash metal act\u2019s conceptual universe, the follower EP to May 2025\u2019s Chronolysis .

First, it\u2019s a one-person project from my hometown of Austin, Texas (the person goes by Vileinist , a clever name for reasons you\u2019ll soon learn). Second, the title of the album is Tesuque , named for a place near Santa Fe in New Mexico that I and family members have visited frequently. And, well, the third reason for getting interested is that Vileinist is a violinist, and uses an electric violin to replace traditional guitar parts throughout the album. The occasion for first paying attention to Ferndom at our site was its release of the first single from Tesuque , a completely captivating song called \u201c Cacophony of Ice \u201c. We\u2019re paying more attention today because we\u2019re premiering a video for the album\u2019s second single, \u201c Stone-Toothed Abyss \u201c.

Its musical output has been prolific: Frozen Ocean has released 11 albums and a variety of shorter works since 2005. Yet there\u2019s been a significant interval between full-lengths since 2015\u2019s Prills of Remembrance . Now a new Frozen Ocean album named Askdr\u00f6mmar is finally on the way, with a release date of February 13th set by the Apocalyptic Witchcraft label. In its previous releases Frozen Ocean has thematically explored a wide range of subjects and inspirations. The new album draws inspiration from the writing of John Ajvide Lindqvist and the music of Lifelover , with lyrics written entirely in Swedish. Its themes are described on behalf of the label this way: Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 7:56 am Tagged with: Frozen Ocean THINGS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED (BUT SHOULDN\u2019T) Album Reviews No Responses \u00bb Feb 05 2026 ( Andy Synn offers up 4 more albums from last month which you may have overlooked) As I may have mentioned in yesterday\u2019s article , it feels like I missed more than the usual number of albums in January\u2026 and while I know that it\u2019s impossible for anyone to properly listen to, let alone review , everything that comes out each month (despite some hyperbolic claims to the contrary by certain online clout-chasers) this has still bothered me quite a bit. After all, we\u2019re only a month into the year and we\u2019ve already managed to overlook the likes of Blackwater Holylight and P\u00e2ro , Ultima and Stabbing , Dagger Threat , Gavran and Juodvarnis (the latter two possibly being lined up for a future edition of The Synn Report each)\u2026 and countless others I\u2019ve probably forgotten about already. At the very least, however, the four vibrant and varied and (in their own way) visceral artists and albums I\u2019ve selected to talk about today should keep you all busy while I work out what I\u2019m going to write about this month!

That tale, which began to unfold in the band\u2019s 2021 debut album Fly the Fiendish Skies , envisioned a group of wealthy passengers fleeing the pandemic in a private jet ( like that ever happened! ), only to crash, descend into cannibalism, and trigger a zombie outbreak. The narrative was so tailor-made for the manifold awfulness of the covid pandemic that it wouldn\u2019t have been surprising if Heir Corpse One had been a \u201cone and done\u201d project. But no, these people obviously had so much fun making that first album that they forged on, not just with the music but with the gruesome concept story. And so now we\u2019re on the verge of getting the second Heir Corpse One album, Destination: Domination . And by \u201cverge\u201d, we mean the brink of February 6th , which is when Emanzipation Productions will disgorge the record. As you\u2019re about to discover first-hand, it\u2019s a ghastly delight. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 8:54 am Tagged with: Heir Corpse One STRANGULIATORIUS:  \u201cFLIES DON\u2019T LIE\u201d Album Reviews No Responses \u00bb Feb 04 2026 (In January Horror Pain Gore Death Productions released a new album from the Lithuanian death metal savages Stranguliatorius , and below we present our Norway-based contributor Chile\u2019s review of this new full-length atrocity.) It is not surprising that metal, one of the shining lights of postmodern art, that paragon of human creativity, has made a foothold in many different places around the world, and is luckily not limited anymore geographically or in any other way. Hailing from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, Stranguliatorius is another one of those worthy entries in our everlasting, world-encompassing quest for all things filthy and deadly. No strangers on these pages, we have been visited by these death dealers before. One of their previous albums got plenty of love here back in 2018, and deservedly so, with our editor calling the band \u201cdamned clever songwriters,\u201d managing to concoct \u201ca toxic brew of old school death metal, grindcore, doom, and d-beat crust\u201d. Sounds good to me. Now, I\u2019ve been to Vilnius some years back and it really is a nice place, but there\u2019s obviously something in the water, as they say, judging by the savage intensity on display. While some death metal bands have that distinctive stench arising from the decaying, rotten flesh with the imagery and riffs that go with it, some acquire a different perspective and put themselves in the role of the cold-blooded, flesh-cutting pathologist himself. Sister, pass the scalpel, please.

Doom on\u2026.) Silent hooded sinister figures in line disappearing into the mist next to a cenotaph as cover artwork, a nearly 25-minute opening track titled \u201cTo Rest Eternally\u201d\u2026 Even before pressing play, you more or less know that you\u2019re treading here on funeral doom territories, and that\u2019s somehow exactly what Lone Wanderer proudly deliver with Exequiae , their third album. But what\u2019s interesting with those Germans is that besides their unusual background \u2013 three out of four members also played pure classic \u201980s heavy-metal with Kerrigan \u2013 and the fact this is being released on High Roller Records, a well-established label and mail-order whose well-deserved reputation was built on high-quality classic metal vinyl reissues \u2014 they\u2019ve managed to somehow tweak their genre\u2019s otherwise firmly established assets into something quite personal, albeit still pretty much in debt to Mournful Congregation, whose mastermind Damon Good actually mixed their first two records. The band collectively agreed to lift the veil on their funeral obsessions\u2026 Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 6:56 am Tagged with: Lone Wanderer , Zoltar AN NCS VIDEO PREMIERE:  CEPHEIDAE VARIABLE \u2014 \u201cTHE CONDUIT\u201d Premieres No Responses \u00bb Feb 03 2026 (written by Islander) Fans of astronomy may pass their eyes over the name Cepheidae Variable , pause, take a second look, and come away puzzled. But the band\u2019s solo creator, Ryan Koepke from British Columbia, Canada, has an explanation: The name \u201c Cepheidae Variable \u201d is a bit of nonsense. I wanted to name the project \u201cCepheid Variable\u201d; however, I quickly realized every word and combination of words under the sun has been used at this point. So it became a play on words, and now it\u2019s about a family of jellyfish. Nonsense it may be, but the story brings a smile \u2014 and so does Cepheidae Variable\u2019s music, though it\u2019s far away from nonsense. As captured on the project\u2019s debut album Primordial Reverie (released last November), it\u2019s a head-spinning but carefully plotted amalgamation of varied inspirations and stylistic ingredients. Ryan\u2019s identification of bands whose music has heavily influenced him gives some sense of that: Dream Theater , Haken , Intervals , Wintersun , and Caligula\u2019s Horse . The album is itself carefully plotted and tells a story, even though it doesn\u2019t include vocals. As he has explained: Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 9:57 am Tagged with: Cepheidae Variable AN NCS PREMIERE:  DISGUSTINGEST \u2014 \u201cDIGITAL CYST\u201d Album Reviews , Premieres , SHORT BUT SWEET No Responses \u00bb Feb 03 2026 (written by Islander) Look around and you can find forms of entertainment (as well as real-world events) that are disgusting . Keep looking and you can find things that are more disgusting . And then there is Disgustingest . Dictionaries and grammarians would frown on that word, but as metal band-names go, it works a lot better than MOST DISGUSTING . But what were these Coloradans thinking when they picked that name? After all, the history of death metal is filled with big rotting piles of maggot-ridden, stomach-churning musical foulness. It\u2019s a high bar to surmount (or if you prefer, a really low one to crawl under) to hold yourself out as Disgustingest . But these people do their damnedest to live up to the challenge, as you\u2019re about to find out. Today we\u2019re helping announce that on February 20th Paper Wings Records will release Disgustingest\u2019s second EP, aptly named Coagulating Putrescence , and we\u2019re also premiering its first single, \u201c Digital Cyst \u201c.

In compiling that list I wound up with 64 songs before forcing myself to stop. That compares to 69 songs on the 2024 list. As always, putting together the list was both fun and stressful \u2014 fun to re-listen to lots of good music and get reminded of what a good year it was for metal, stressful because list-making of any kind is so difficult for me. Also as usual, my list didn\u2019t cover the entire waterfront of metal genres, given the limitations of my own (still very expansive) tastes, And of course, as is true every year, I really wasn\u2019t finished when I stopped. A lot of candidates just as worthy as the 64 I chose were left by the wayside when I hit the February wall. Maybe some others will be honored by other writers (last year, for example, both DGR and Andy Synn added addenda to the list), but I don\u2019t know if or when that might happen this year, so I\u2019m doing this wrap-up post now.
