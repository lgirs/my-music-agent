Still To The Grave So TO THE GRAVE are an Australian deathcore band who formed way back in 2010, [\u2026] Spiritual Chains Thorndale So we have THORNDALE who are a four piece stoner rock/doom metal band who have [\u2026] Demo 2026 Savage Sword The production isn't great, and I love it. Lost and Amsterdamned El Muerto \"Lost and Amsterdamend\"\u00a0is a resplendent, yet dark album, and I want to hear more of this project down the road. Private Affairs Steve Emm Steve Emm has been passionate about music since early childhood.At the age of 14, he [\u2026] Mayhem Mavericks Mayhem Mavericks Hailing from Brescia, Italy, Mayhem Mavericks are a hard rock outfit that blends raw power [\u2026] Dissonance Meteora \u201cDissonance\u201d is a satisfying final installment to the \u201cDarkest Light\u201d trilogy. Kun Valo Minussa Kuoli Kaunis Kuolematon I have to believe KAUNIS KUOLEMATON is at the forefront of the Finnish metal scene, a position they certainly deserve as evidenced by \u201cKun Valo Minussa Kuoli.\u201d Cemetery Hallucinations Moros Overall, this was a solid album. The band\u2019s focus on the deep end of their sound keeps the riffs sounding massive, and towering. Add in the bass, which thickens it up further, and the vocals, which are raging and tortured, and you have a recipe for a good listening experience. Echoes Of Isolation Defecto I do feel that the music that DEFECTO plays on \u201cEchoes Of Isolation\u201d has all the hallmarks of a band that is letting loose, giving it their all. I therefore have to admit that for the first time in 2026, I am smitten. What a brilliant treat this is. Rogue Angels Starlight Ritual The vocals have surprised me. At times Damian Ritual sounds a lot like the late Paul Di\u2019Anno, mainly due to him having the same kind of vibrato, but also because on some songs the vocal lines sound as if they could have straight out the deceased frontman\u2019s pen. But when he goes shrill and high he has a bit of Dave Mustaine in his voice as well. Divine Spiritual and Intellectual Development (and all demos) Usurper I actually have the original CD of the USURPER album \u201cDivine Spiritual and Intellectual Development\u201d in my possession. What we have here is the Dutch Thrash Metal version of USURPER, a band that was very active in the second half of the eighties up and until the early nineties. Rust and Bones My Darkest Hate Ever since their first demo cassette in 1998, German-based death metal band\u00a0My Darkest Hate has [\u2026] Something Happened on the Way to Hell Chained to the Dead Cut it out with the damn samples. Unending Rotting Cycle Putrevore Putrevore\u00a0is a plain, humble death metal duo consisting of vocalist\u00a0Dave Rotten and guitarist/bassist\u00a0Rogga Johansson.\u00a0Rogga is [\u2026] Kickstarter Bullet The Swedish band Bullet got together in autumn 2001, with the aim of playing traditional [\u2026] Time To Die E.P Gabrielle De Val \u201cTime To Die\u201d the title track from this EP is inspired by the cult 80\u2019s [\u2026] The Legend of Johnny Gnasch Gnasch The album is crushing, in the way that time turns the ashes of Kings into dust. In death, we all are insignificant. As I mentioned above, it also points to a repetitive cycle that most humans find themselves caught up in and don\u2019t question it. Shit, there has to be more to life than this, doesn\u2019t there? The Parson\u2019s Tale Balistic I always appreciate a good Progressive music album set to a theme. The spoken words helped to keep the story on track, and the music shifted from dark to spots of light at times, although in keeping with the theme, it was mostly done in the shadows. The band\u2019s musicianship was strong, and I would like to hear more from them. Atoned in Metamorphosis Predatory Void Although it\u2019s just an EP, the band gave me a full taste of flavor, and I am intrigued. Indeed, they do blend a lot of genres together into a soup that has seasoning. But, if you try to separate out the parts, you will ruin the recipe. You just need to sit back and let it blend together, despite how uncomfortable it might make you feel. Blackdemonium Astarte While this may not be an album I ever really go back to, I appreciated the time I had with it, and R.I.P.\u00a0Tristessa. Aggravate Violent Testimony The thrash-turned-grindcore project\u00a0Violent Testimony\u00a0released their first \"full-length\" LP\u00a0\"Aggravate\"\u00a0via\u00a0HPGD Records.\u00a0\"Full length\" is used lightly in a [\u2026] Born In Darkness Naraka If you read the Metal Encyclopaedia site they play Melodic Death Metal. Well, that is very narrow, if you ask me. What NARAKA does will have you going from Gothic Rock via Movie Metal up and until the mentioned Melodic Death Metal. I understand that the net is cast wide by these descriptions, but they do fit the bill. This Life Is A Grave Dead Sun If I had to classify in what range of Death Metal to put \u201cThis Life Is A Grave\u201d it would actually be easy listening, as the level of simplicity, accessibility and ease to your ears this is one of the easiest albums I have ever listened to in this particular musical genre. Benediction Part 2 Sodality Overall, this wasn\u2019t a bad album by any stretch\u2026it had an evil and harrowing sound. It just didn\u2019t bring anything new to the genre. Retrodeath Bonginator Weed and games and memes and nostalgia! All of these words properly describe the vibrant death metal outfit\u00a0Bonginator. Bygone Bygone Bygone is the self titled LP of the heavy metal band Bygone from Boston, Massachusetts. [\u2026] Ensis The Holeum This was an outstanding album for me, and their genre/style can\u2019t be pigeon holed. Part Doom, part Post Rock, part Progressive, and part Death, it\u2019s the way that they mix these styles and the way they constantly shift between the two that is the best feature of the album. It forces me into a reflective state to ponder the many mysteries of the universe\u2026and they are ones that we will never have answers for in our lifetime. Still, that exercise of deep thought isn\u2019t a waste of time. Flamecore Flamecore How could I have missed this little nugget of Greek melodeath? Stillamentum Gorrch In many ways, it\u2019s the purity of the album that makes it so compelling. I don\u2019t usually like a tracklist where each song has a similar pace, but this one, goes so deep underground and so far into the stars, I don\u2019t mind. A warning however\u2026don\u2019t listen to this album in the dark, because its fury and vengeance might close your eyes forever. Atonement Lost in Existence It\u2019s that contrast that keeps the music alive and energetic. I could do without the \u201cbleghs,\u201d but it was a solid listening experience for me. They have the talent and the vision\u2026for next time, I would take a few more chances to help create that distance from their peers. Harbinger of Revenge and War Garde Viking metal... A niche genre popularized by the efforts of\u00a0Bathory,\u00a0Moonsorrow,\u00a0and literally any other Nordic black metal band that wanted to get a little folky and LARP-y. Down In Flames Glasgow Kiss I guess it kind of sounds like\u00a0Within Temptation maybe? Iron Vengeance: Crusader's Fury Crusaders Thrash metal band\u00a0Crusaders\u00a0rips through the music scene with their debut album,\u00a0Iron Vengeance: The Crusader's Fury\u00a0which [\u2026] More results...

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

Grand Theft Auto V Nov 18, 2014 \u2022 Rated M The sprawling sun-soaked metropolis of Los Santos is chock full of self-help coaches, starlets and C-List celebrities, once on top of the media world, now struggling to stay relevant in time of economic malaise and lowest-common-denominator reality TV.

Half-Life 2 Nov 16, 2004 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2004 PC Game of the Year]  By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies.

[Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Malignant Aura \u2013 Where All of Worth Comes to Wither Review By Owlswald on January 27, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Doom Metal , 25 comments \u201cThe marriage of death and doom is a well-trodden path, but Malignant Aura \u2019s 2022 debut proved they had quickly mastered the formula. Abysmal Misfortune is Draped Upon Me was a crushing blend of old-school death metal (OSDM) misery and funeral desolation, establishing the Australian quartet as another worthy addition to an already vibrant scene. Now a part of the Memento Mori roster, their sophomore effort, Where All of Worth Comes to Wither , arrives to push Malignant Aura out of the nether realm and into a world all their own.\u201d Aura Borealis. URNE \u2013 Setting Fire to the Sky Review By Lavender Larcenist on January 27, 2026 in Reviews , Hardcore , Metalcore , 41 comments \u201cThe evolution of a band is a fickle thing. Change too much, and you alienate those who started the journey with you; change too little and bore listeners over time, leaving only ardent fans of the sound. URNE , a London three-piece with close ties to Gojira and Mastodon , has already shown a surprising amount of reformation by their third release, Setting Fire to the Sky . The band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debut, SERPENT & SPIRIT , was a hard-edged mix of post-hardcore, sweeping grooves, and raw vocals, with a little bit of sludge thrown into their clean-singing.\u201d Urneing the fire. Invictus \u2013 Nocturnal Visions Review By Kenstrosity on January 26, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 75 comments \u201cFive years ago, I highlighted Invictus \u2019 2020 debut LP Catacombs of Fear as part of our year-end death metal roundup feature. Since then, the Japanese death metal trio toiled under the ground with a brutal live schedule and steadily wrote what might very well be my most highly anticipated follow-up in the death metal realm. Hot on the heels of killer releases from personal favorites like Depravity , and jumping just ahead of another highly anticipated salvo from Eximperitus , Invictus \u2019 upcoming Nocturnal Visions has big shoes to fill and stiff competition to combat.\u201d Captaining the soul. ZU \u2013 Ferrum Sidereum Review By Andy-War-Hall on January 26, 2026 in Reviews , Djent , Industrial Metal , Instrumental Metal , Progressive Metal , 34 comments \u201cLiteral metals are always cooler when they come from space. A blade forged from meteoric iron is effectively the same as one made from iron you can find on Earth, but don\u2019t tell me you wouldn\u2019t want the space knife way more. Likewise, metal music always sounds cooler when it feels like it\u2019s from another world. Enter ZU , the Italian jazz metal trio comprised of guitarist/bassist Massimo Pupillo, saxophonist/keyboardist Luca Mai, and drummer Paolo Mangardi.\u201d Zu Zu pedals! Weft \u2013 The Splintered Oar Review By Killjoy on January 25, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Folk Metal , Progressive Metal , 30 comments \u201cBlack metal and the violin go together like peanut butter and jelly, which makes it particularly exciting when an artist who is accomplished in both steps forward. Weft is the solo endeavor of Charlie Anderson, the live violinist for Panopticon . His debut album, The Splintered Oar , is one of two releases by Bindrune Recordings on the weekend before the beginning of Listurnalia 2025. Nevertheless, this is a record that should not go unnoticed during the time of year when many of us have adopted either a backward- or forward-looking mindset.\u201d Black strings and negative feelings. The Graying of Dave the Red: Taking Megadeth\u2019s Last Stand to the Rode\u00c3\u00b6 By Steel Druhm on January 24, 2026 in Angry Metal Guy's Unsigned Band Rodeo , Thrash Metal , 139 comments A legendary band like Megadeth releasing their last album calls for a very special Rode\u00c3\u00b6. Join us as we take Dave Mustaine to the bull shop for one last ride. Barbarian \u2013 Reek of God Review By Mark Z. on January 23, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Heavy Metal , Speed Metal , Thrash Metal , 12 comments \u201cSometime in the 2010s, I started disliking music with too many flourishes and began seeking out stuff that was more stripped-down, unpolished, and primitive. At this time, Barbarian were the perfect find. Depending on the album, this Italian trio has referred to themselves as \u201cRegressive Metal,\u201d \u201cAbsolute Metal,\u201d or, in the case of their sixth album, Reek of God , \u201cRetrogarde Metal\u201d (typo and all). Led by vocalist and guitarist \u201cBorys Crossburn,\u201d their sound is essentially early Celtic Frost if they were fronted by a guitar-wielding grizzly bear who had a bizarre penchant for the occasional Running Wild -style melody.\u201d Smells like God in here! Temptress \u2013 hear Review By Killjoy on January 23, 2026 in Reviews , Doom Metal , Stoner Metal , 19 comments \u201cThe best things in life often happen organically. Temptress began in 2019 in Dallas, Texas, as three friends casually jamming together, and they had enough natural chemistry to decide to take their alluring stoner doom to the studio. Like someone who is well-versed in the art of seduction, they appear to be working their way through each of the five senses. Their debut full-length, see , was born in 2023, but now the time has come to close your eyes and hear what Temptress has conjured up for their sophomore record.\u201d hear in the now. Battering Ram \u2013 Time Masters Review By Baguette of Bodom on January 23, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Power Metal , Thrash Metal , 17 comments \u201cOccasionally, pet projects and casual fun bands can take a very long time to gestate into something more serious and tangible. Spain\u2019s Battering Ram has had quite a long journey to get to their self-released debut album Time Masters , starting from their formation in 2008 and their demos in the early 2010s. Over this time period, their ambitions have also grown. Evolved from just another thrash metal band, Time Masters is a sci-fi concept album looking to fuse epic heavy and power metal with technical thrash metal.\u201d Time is the fire in which we burn. Furi Helium \u2013 No Altar Stands Eternal Review By Dr. A.N. Grier on January 22, 2026 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 59 comments \u201cAfter list season comes to an end, there\u2019s an involuntary sigh of relief that all the work got done, and while a lot of the lists were shit, stylistically and format-wise, they looked good. But the first review of the year is a different kind of sigh. Not one of relief but one of \u2018here we go again.\u2019 So, with my knuckles cracked and promo downloaded, I dive into Spanish thrashers, Furi Helium , and their sophomore outing, No Altar Stands Eternal .\u201d Altared states.

Bloque Fuerte y Firme EP Seven-track debut from straightedge outfit BLOQUE, whose traditional take on the style doesn\u2019t lead to too many surprises outside of the occasional dive-bomb guitar. I expected it to be a little more thrash-y after the intro, but it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Breakdowns and gang vocals abound, with clear influence from GORILLA BISCUITS and JUDGE. Catch them on tour with SHELTER this year. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label BCore / Cementerio / Conviction / Refuse Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Corpse on Delivery \u2026And Another War+ LP Stripped-down and in your face Ohio peace punk from the mind of MARBLES drummer Mark Slak. ZERO BOYS vibes with tinges of CIRCLE ONE and other early West Coast acts with a modern interpretation that owes more to fellow Midwesterners CRACKS or California transplants NAKED AGGRESSION. \u2026And Another War was released digitally early last year, but the \u201c+\u201d here is the rest of their discography dating back to the Roots of War EP in 2023. Twenty-three tracks in all\u2014a soundtrack to an upfront anti-imperialist, anti-Trump, pro-liberation agenda. Reviewer Robert Collins Label Sick House Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Deep X Cut How to Be Normal cassette Damn, that\u2019s a fast recording. Six minutes, barely a cig break. The big \u201cX\u201d stuck between the two words making out the name of the band gives a relevant indication as to what this Greek band is all about: (very) fast, abrasive hardcore. We\u2019re not far from classic powerviolence country here with those heavy moshable breaks and a couple of blastbeats. I don\u2019t listen to this style much, to be honest, but I can always enjoy it when it is done proper, and that\u2019s definitely the case here. The female vocals sound really angry and the production is just right, not too heavy but still hitting hard the punk way. The lyrics are in Greek\u2014that\u2019s a strong plus\u2014but the tape\u2019s title is in English for some reason. How to Be Normal is apparently DEEP X CUT\u2019s third EP, and the band is connected to a collective based in a squat in Ioannina, so you know where they stand politically. This would undoubtedly appeal a lot to fans of the genre. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Distro K94 / Nothing to Harvest / Studio From the Down Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Dom Sensitive Leather Trim cassette DOM SENSITIVE, a new studio project from Adelaide musician Dom Trimboli of WIREHEADS, is a late-night, psych-heavy pastiche of synth swells, boom-bap drum machine patterns, and viiibes . \u201cDigital Random Hat\u201d opens the tape with a loping beat, accordion-aping synth, and laconic vocals that sound like KING KRULE reciting cough syrup poetry. This leads to a surprisingly earnest bar-room piano bridge complete with synthesized trumpet backing, like a bizarre BILLY JOEL D-side. Slow-moving, but oddly propulsive, the sound follows its own odd logic and tricked me into thinking, \u201cYeah, music sounds like this sometimes,\u201d when it doesn\u2019t. \u201cThe Second Day of Spring\u201d is an eleven-minute journey of hip hop piano production with funky synth sax solo breaks that details an autobiographical tale of seeing a man about a horse. Or something. Picture the nerve of sending MRR an eleven-minute dad-psych jam! In this economy of short attention spans?! It\u2019s actually quite listenable, and I can picture this record spinning on turntables in hip parties that I probably wouldn\u2019t be invited to. \u201cWeather Maps\u201d takes a folky guitar trip reminiscent of BECK\u2019s early K records days, and as a whole, the carefree and laid-back feel of the album is recommended to fans of slightly off-center indie like MAC DEMARCO. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Chr\u00fcsim\u00fcsi Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 The Educated Fools Tantric Decapitation: 69 Minutes of Trichotomy and Liquefaction 2xLP Sixty-nine minutes of boring, country-esque guitar playing. Sixty-nine minutes of the most boring, off-kilter, pseudo-Americana bullshit. Sixty-nine minutes that I can never get back. The EDUCATED FOOLS are the RETAIL SIMPS, minus one member. They recorded this entire double LP live, and boy, does it show! It\u2019s full of mistakes, background banter, and out-of-tune vocals. If that\u2019s your thing, you might be into this, but you\u2019d also have to dig subpar songwriting. Nothing about these songs is memorable except for how bad they are. Tantric decapitation sounds more fun than having to listen to this record again. Totally not punk. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Total Punk Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Function Creep Function Creep demo cassette According to the liner notes, these guys recorded this directly with no overdubs, and if that\u2019s true, then they absolutely fucking nailed it. This is raw in the best way possible, extremely tight and polished for a demo that was done live in a living room. The music is a fun mixture of early \u201990s noise rock like JESUS LIZARD/RED SWAN/DINOSAUR JR. and sinister-sounding West Coast hardcore akin to early DEAD KENNEDYS and T.S.O.L. The energy is palpable, and you can tell these folks are having a great time. I wish more modern punk sounded this way. No corny studio frills, just pure rock\u2019n\u2019roll. You gotta check this one out. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Out of Many, One Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Gumm Beneath the Wheel LP Ten new tracks of melodic hardcore from Chattanooga rockers GUMM. Convulse\u2019s writeup for GUMM\u2019s debut mentions inspiration from Revolution Summer material; that influence can be heard here as well. Equally as frustrated as it is hopeful, the words match the music, which are both at times catchy and upbeat as well as discordant and downtrodden. A nicely produced and thoughtful record that isn\u2019t my usual thing, but one I enjoyed nevertheless. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Convulse Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Hyperspace Distant Signals LP HYPERSPACE\u2019s Distant Signals LP is clean and well-produced pop punk. Bands that come to mind are early GREEN DAY, EGGHEAD, SICKO, the CONNIE DUNGS, and the like. There are plenty of songs on here about having crushes, pining away caused by an unrequited crush, a song or two about the motion picture Star Wars , a song about the motion picture franchise Terminator , being judged about not being punk enough, and plenty more topics where those came from. There are clever songs about Russian space history, goth inspiration for DC Comics, Area 51 lore, and so on. Distant Signals is a fun spin that was created for anyone that enjoys anything I\u2019ve mentioned here. Reviewer Tony Party Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Lost Legion / Sympos split EP This LOST LEGION / SYMPOS split keeps things simple, with each band tossing in two tracks and sticking firmly to what they do best. SYMPOS play straight-up, working-class street punk from Waterford, Ireland, pulling hard from UK \u201977 without sounding like a tribute act. Their opener, \u201cWelcome to Ballybricken,\u201d is the high point on the record for me, ripping through two minutes of upbeat urgency that feels scrappy, direct, and genuinely fun. Chicago\u2019s LOST LEGION, featuring Ian Wise of FUERZA BRUTA and Foreign Legion Records, counters with their brand of Oi! that leans heavier and more reflective. For me, \u201cStuck in One Place\u201d lands hardest, a surprisingly catchy and (dare I say) danceable song with lyrics that wrestle with the feeling of being locked into a violent identity. No filler, no grand statements, just four solid tracks that balance energy, hooks, and hard-earned perspective. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Mister Face / Tough Ain't Enough Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Maraudeur Flaschent\u00e4ger LP MARAUDER\u2019s Flaschent\u00e4ger is an absolutely mesmerizing collection of ten short and straight-to-the-point post-punk jams. Though the term post-punk is very ambiguous and rarely gives any idea to what to expect, I\u2019m happy to say that this album turned out to be the kind that perfectly fits into my personal idea of what the term implies: an immense and somewhat liminal vibe created by the perfect alignment of tastefully minimalistic elements. With its catchy hooks, beautifully layered guitars and bass, and lovely sparkles of synth lines, Flaschent\u00e4ger is one of those albums that invoke \u201cin-between\u201d emotions and mental states that I haven\u2019t found the right words for yet. Sure, you can dance to it. But it\u2019s also good for laying in bed and watching the ceiling for a while. Can\u2019t recommend this one enough. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label Feel It / Kakakids / Red Wig Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 N.E. Vains Running Down Pylons LP N.E. VAINS make music that sounds like it should be playing on the car stereo of your dad\u2019s old Buick as you drive around with your friends, drinking beers, and being degenerate little shitheads. At the core, it reminds me of \u201990s budget rock bands like NEW BOMB TURKS, but with an undeniable HEARTBREAKERS influence to the guitar riffs and a dash of snotty punk energy thrown in for good measure. The record clocks in at seventeen minutes, and even with a couple of lulls, songs like \u201cThe Grounds,\u201d \u201cRunning Down Pylons,\u201d and \u201cPinched Nerve\u201d make it worth picking up. Put it on the stereo next time you want to drive around lighting bags of shit on fire and smashing mailboxes! Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Big Neck Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Pool Pool cassette There was a time in my twenties when it seemed like all I ever wanted to listen to was Amphetamine Reptile releases, and I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the only one. Hailing from Little Rock, Arkansas, POOL is keeping the sludgy noise rock dream alive and well, with high-register, snarling vocals up in the mix and riffs pouring out that harken back to when MELVINS still lifted from heavy metal or when NIRVANA still lifted from MELVINS. This is a confident-as-hell debut that is recorded damn near-perfectly. There\u2019s a lot of room in the mix that everything rings clear even if there\u2019s some mud on the band\u2019s boots. Heavy, mean, timeless. When a band starts out this good, I can\u2019t help but wait on pins for where they go from here. Reviewer Luke Henley Label Hey Fuck You Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Scrape Flood cassette Strong debut collection of down-tuned doom metal that is more about subterranean, ultra-distorted chugging and monumental chord changes than it is about riffs. Slow-moving and powerful, the band operates in a similar spirit as KOWLOON WALLED CITY or WINDHAND and captures an intense atmosphere of hopelessness and misanthropy with lyrics rife with corporeal imagery of poisons, bloody hands, drowning, etc. The opening crunch of tracks like \u201cStuck\u201d and \u201cThe Taking\u201d hits hard, and I can imagine seeing them performed live would be like a musical punch to the chest. Crushing and bleak. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Broken Sound Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Sc\u00fcmbari Sc\u00fcmbari LP From Boston with hate\u2014they don\u2019t bother polishing the edges, they chisel them into shards instead. At first listen, SC\u00dcMBARI sounds like the CIRCLE JERKS playing DISCHARGE covers, but as the songs keep rolling, they deliver versatile songwriting encompassing various styles within a hardcore punk framework. The lyrics rage on about broken lives, city blight, unsteady nights, and the broken dreams of those locked in a system that never cared. What you get is scruffy honesty, hostility wrapped in distortion, and punk that remembers it came from the streets, not a studio. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Slit Demo 2025 cassette Primitive, noisy hardcore punk operating on pure chaos. SLIT tears through these tracks with reckless speed and total disregard for clarity or comfort. Feedback-soaked riffs and feral vocals dominate, capturing a band at its most raw and unhinged. Hardcore punk primitivo y ruidoso que funciona desde el caos absoluto. SLIT atraviesa los temas a toda velocidad, sin respeto por la claridad ni la comodidad. Riffs saturados y voces salvajes dominan todo. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Upside Down Man Fairy Tale for a Modern Age 12\u2033 UPSIDE DOWN MAN does not back away from melody and tight-as-hell articulated musicianship. It\u2019s easy to make comparisons to PROPAGANDHI with their styled and personalized lyrics, but stopping there would also do a disservice to UPSIDE DOWN MAN. These six songs work to amplify a current disconnect we are all feeling with the world happening around us while trying to draw in that helpless feeling by moving toward action through that commonality, or they are about a harsh breakup, as they are all perfectly vague enough to be about whatever you want them to be about. I\u2019m continually brought back to the razor-sharp production where you can hear every single note and drum hit perfectly while still maintaining the momentum of a bullet train. In the \u201990s and \u201900s, this would have been an easy fit on Fat Wreck Chords or Epitaph with the their three metrics hitting at one hundred percent: speed, clarity, and another one too, I was going somewhere with that but I got distracted by the song and started bobbing my head. If you like those things mentioned above, then you\u2019ll like the link linked below. Reviewer Tony Party Label Sketchy Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Wacky Star Nukular Summer demo cassette Recorded on a TEAC-1200 dual cassette deck, Miami\u2019s WACKY STAR gives us a lo-fi taste of Florida scuzz, brought to mind on \u201cAway From\u201d with the chant \u201cDon\u2019t you know that I\u2019m just a piece of shit.\u201d This has the feel of a solo project, but no names are credited on the demo, which is limited to twenty copies. While the punk world may be flooded with the sweeping moods of bedroom artists, it\u2019s hard to not enjoy this type of homemade thing. I can see ballpoint-penned composition books, a dirt-encrusted keyboard, a corner with too many guitars backed into it, a pile of cassettes, cables like vines covering the floor\u2026this may not be life-altering, but it sure feels good. Favorite track: \u201cThe Light.\u201d Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Rip Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 X At Home With You LP reissue Five years after their debut album Aspirations , 1985\u2019s sophomore full-length At Home With You showcased a new depth for the seminal Australian group X. The record mixes commercial sensibilities (the melodious, brass-laden part of \u201cT.V. Glue\u201d is easily imagined as the background for a television advertisement) with unabashed punk ethos that can most readily be detected in frontman Steve Lucas\u2019s expressive, sore-throated vocals. The album features ambitious and artful musicianship, and even an atmospheric ballad in the smoky \u201cDon\u2019t Cry No Tears,\u201d while the band\u2019s pub-rockin\u2019 roots are still on display in tracks like \u201cDegenerate Boy\u201d (a re-working of one of their earlier songs) and the bouncy \u201cShe\u2019s Gone.\u201d While it positions its maturity up front, spending a bit of time at home with this newly-reissued LP will assure you that you\u2019re still tuned into the same delightfully abrasive outfit that produced the classic posthumously-released 1977 X-Spurts sessions. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Sorcerer Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Yellow Wallpaper Choose Death 12\u2033 YELLOW WALLPAPER out of Lexington, Kentucky released the Choose Death EP in the fall of last year. The four-song EP opens with the title track which is very reminiscent of CHRISITIAN DEATH. A more post-punk influence infests the remainder of the disc, with the song \u201cSilly Goose\u201d drawing upon a vague WIRE-like energy. The nearly eight-minute closer \u201cWhere the Water Meets the Sky\u201d harnesses a danceable TALKING HEADS bass line to screeching guitar drifts and croony vocals singing lines about where a good place to die may be. Overall, Choose Death is worth the listen. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Desperate Spirits Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Zyclone Visions of Impending Death EP Despite some etymological digging the origin of their name, ZYCLONE remains shrouded in mystery to me. A reworking of the name \u201cZyklon B\u201d? An easy way to end up close to ZYGOME and ZYGOTE on one\u2019s record shelf? An inability to spell \u201ccyclone\u201d properly? Who knows. If the linguistics are foggy, the power of the band is not: ZYCLONE absolutely delivers. In fact, this might be one of the strongest k\u00e4ng-inspired EPs of 2025, although probably more by way of Japan (to be understood as aesthetics rather than geography) rather than a direct flight to Stockholm, as the distortion is higher than with your usual Scandicore act but still below the last floor of the fuzz building (a.k.a. Osaka). I love the sound of the drums here, and the overall drumming, in fact. A band like K.O.S. (or even FRAMTID) is definitely not miles away, but ZYCLONE has more ANTI CIMEX in their beefy recipe. The six minutes of music on this EP offer exactly what you expect from a good band of this genre\u2014my one (very) minor criticism would be the use of the binary tupa-tupa beat in the song \u201cVisions of Impeding Death,\u201d because I don\u2019t think it quite fits here. As I said, very minor. The members are apparently spread out in North America, but I\u2019m told they are also involved in bands like PSYCH WAR, ELECTRIKA, and AUTOMATED EXECUTION. This EP was released on General Speech, an always reliable label when it comes to quality raw, noisy hardcore. Reviewer Romain Basset Label General Speech Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Arson Burning Future EP There are few things in life that get my blood pumping as thoroughly as NYC raw punk, and ARSON is a pacemaker set to overdrive. On their latest release Burning Future , their six tracks of noise-drenched crasher crust harkens to ANTI-CIMEX greased up with ZYANOSE. If you missed ARSON\u2019s 2024 release M\u00e1s Noise, or if your life hasn\u2019t felt right since PERDITION broke up, then now would be a great time to check out ARSON. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label General Speech Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Beta Voids Scrape It Off 10\u2033 It would be easy to talk about the saxophone, but listen to BETA VOIDS hard-charge through brilliantly crafted, hardcore-tinged, multi-vocal blasts of punk, and you almost forget that there\u2019s this weird woodwind layer lurking in the shadows on every track\u2026so instead of talking about the saxophone, I think it\u2019s better to just acknowledge its existence and move on. The songs, though \u2014the songs are straight killers. Timeless, high-energy cuts that owe a debt to early California hardcore while firmly maintaining their own unique and expressive character. And \u201ccharacter\u201d is really the word I\u2019ve been looking for while I listen to Scrape It Off (again)\u2014that\u2019s the thing BETA VOIDS have, and it\u2019s the quality that you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re missing in your punk until you hear it. Apparently they do things different in coastal Oregon. Reviewer Robert Collins Label Hovercraft Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Brut MMXXIII \u2013 MMXXIV LP This is very unique and different\u2014a combination of post-punk and Oi! (which becomes even more apparent when you reach the JOY DIVISION and BLITZ covers later on in the slab). This is a collection of several singles and EPs that BRUT released between 2023 and 2024. The guitarist is playing at such high octaves that I thought they were running a mandolin through a chorus pedal at first. Maybe they are, there are no liner notes included. It gives the tracks this real dreamy quality that pairs well with the treble-heavy bass and dark, barking vocals. Extremely catchy and well-constructed tunes here. A very impressive output for a single calendar year. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Street Rats Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Chance Operation Chance Operation 12\u2033 reissue No New York might have signaled the beginning of the end of New York no wave in its labelling, defining, and constraining a scene that purposely took root as a negation of such things, but meanwhile, there was an entire parallel network of Japanese bands forming in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s who were directly inspired by the anarchic, brink-of-collapse art-spark that had made New York\u2019s downtown sound so thrilling. CHANCE OPERATION was one of the very best to do it, not unlike a James Chance-less CONTORTIONS if you wanted to get simplistic\u2014ultra-trebly (and frequently slide-manipulated) chicken-scratch guitar, loping mutant funk bass lines, minimalist, jazz-schooled drumming. This five-song 12\u201d (one of three CHANCE OPERATION records recently reissued as part of Spittle\u2019s Made in Japan side venture) was originally released in 1981, sounding for all intents and purposes like it came straight from the floor of the Mudd Club, from \u201cWinecolor Sick\u201d slinking and skronking beneath sparse, perfectly disinterested vocals from bassist Higo Hiroshi and guitarist Yoshiko Komiyama, to the fractured disco-not-disco danceability of \u201cImage Dance,\u201d to the cyclical bass rumble tussling with pinpoint guitar in \u201cDin.\u201d Do I even have to say that it rules? Seek out 1982\u2019s Spare Beauty EP and 1985\u2019s Place Kick LP while you\u2019re at it, it\u2019s easier to do so now than ever before! Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Spittle Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Der Moderne Man Unmodern LP reissue Originally released in 1982 as DER MODERNE MAN\u2019s second studio album, Tapete has reissued this along with the band\u2019s first LP, 80 Tage Auf See , as well as some previously unreleased singles, EPs, and demos (on the Jugend Forscht 2xLP). Based in Hanover, Germany, DER MODERNE MAN found themselves at the forefront of the punk and new wave scenes coming out of the area, freely mixing genres and styles. The opener \u201cAnakonda\u201d starts with a moody feel, featuring a slinky bass line and some spooky vocals, only to move on to dub influences on songs like \u201cNur Die,\u201d featuring some classic reggae synths, guitars, and saxophones. I also hear psych rock guitars on \u201cNicht Warten,\u201d followed by a danceable, poppy electronic beat on \u201cGurus und Geheimagenten.\u201d All to say, this album is full of texture, surprises, and is certainly worth your time. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Tapete Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Expunge / Panic Defense Tools to Kill Humans split cassette One man\u2019s anger is another man\u2019s weapon. EXPUNGE and PANIC DEFENSE share members and even jam on each others\u2019 songs. This collective decided to immortalize their love for the void with Tools to Kill Humans . It pounds on your eardrums with serrated riffs and punk ferocity coated with an oily layer of feedback. Each track is a wrecking ball of chaos that emulates the bleakness of a dystopian age. It\u2019s primitive, it\u2019s aggressive, it\u2019s messy, and it\u2019s grinding violence. For those who\u2019ve already given up on fixing the system. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Hey Fuck You Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Flores y Fuego Wabi-Sabi cassette Raw and emotional punk that embraces imperfection as a weapon. FLORES Y FUEGO balance melody and abrasion, letting cracked vocals and rough edges carry the emotional weight. The songs feel intimate but still aggressive, with a DIY urgency that comes through loud and clear. The cassette format only sharpens that immediacy. Punk crudo y emotivo que toma la imperfecci\u00f3n como arma. Flores y Fuego equilibran melod\u00eda y aspereza, dejando que las voces quebradas y los bordes filosos carguen el peso emocional. Las canciones son \u00edntimas pero agresivas, con una urgencia DIY muy marcada. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Decline Humano Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Fosgene Ancora Tumulti Ancora Tempesta cassette With the release of their second tape, Bassano del Grappa\u2019s FOSGENE re-emerges as a dense and direct force of nuanced D-beat power. Although you can hear the menace of Italian champions like WRETCHED and IMPACT in their twisting riffs and charging hardcore, it\u2019s black around the edges and tempered by crusty dystopian dirges, taking the sound to places the aforementioned bands only hinted at. With intelligent tackling of heavy political and social subjects in the lyrics, there\u2019s a stream of anarcho energy to the carefully composed tracks as well, furthering their alluring complexity. It\u2019s strong stuff, a dark stew that leaves you ready to explore these savage expanses further. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Sistema Mortal Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Gino and the Goons Gino and the Goons LP It\u2019s been long enough since I last thought about this band that the word \u201cgoon\u201d has taken on a cool new meaning. Just one more thing I gotta wrestle with as I give these dudes another go! Anyway, I\u2019ve always liked the idea of GINO AND THE GOONS\u2014a handful of Floridians approaching middle-age (probably full-blown at this point!), who seemingly didn\u2019t have a history playing music, saying \u201cfuck it\u201d and forming a budget rock band at a time when most punks wanted nothing to do with that sound. Real laudable shit! Unfortunately, that admiration did little in the way of helping me enjoy their music. I never hated it or anything, but their songs just never did it for me. So, I went into this release, their sixth(!) LP, with pretty low expectations. Now, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because my expectations were so low, because I\u2019ve mellowed a little in the ten-ish years since I last listened to them, or because they\u2019ve grown as songwriters\u2014probably some combination of all three\u2014but I kinda dug this. The nine tracks that make up the record mix RAMONES-y dum-dum punk, glam, and druggy garage punk (think fellow Sunshine Staters JACUZZI BOYS). Am I ready to erect a GOON cave for some prolonged GOON seshes? I am not. But this record was OK enough to get the job done. Reviewer Alex Howell Label Slovenly Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Megaphonies Right to Double Down CD Melodic and fuzzy power pop from Sacramento. Heavy, deep riffage that brings to mind DEATH FROM ABOVE 1979 and a slew of classic rock bands; kind of like a modern, punked-up version of FOGHAT. This is a pretty bluesy-sounding album, lyrically and musically, which is shockingly refreshing. Production sounds great and the band comes off huge for being just a trio. I won\u2019t lie, this was an unexpected hit for me. I wasn\u2019t sure what a band called MEGAPHONIES was going to sound like, and they completely blew me out of the water. You\u2019re gonna wanna spin this one a couple times. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Minot Walls / People Pleaser 7\u2033 Lo-fi, pop-tinged garage punk from Missoula, Montana. The A-side \u201cPeople Pleaser\u201d sounds like Toody Cole fronting the VELVET UNDERGROUND or BEAT HAPPENING; sparse instrumentation with chilling vocals and a cool organ line throughout it. The B-side \u201cWalls\u201d was not as interesting. The vocals annoyed me so badly that I couldn\u2019t finish the song, and I tried twice. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Phantom Pike Phantom Pike demo cassette Nothing warms my cold Midwestern heart more than hearing good new punk music from Illinois, and Central Illinois no less. PHANTOM PIKE is a fresh outfit based in Springfield who take UK82/Oi!, add black metal vocals and some dramatic instrumentals, and dress it all up in chainmail. They call it \u201cSkull Rock,\u201d and you know what? It does fucking rock. Check this one out. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Mister Face Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Schenectavoidz Void Beyond the Pines LP Hardcore punk bong attack! SCHENECTAVOIDZ have crashed back into the world with a release that feels like the spiritual (and extremely stoned) offspring of their old band DEVOID OF FAITH, but weirder and way more THC-soaked. Void Beyond the Pines sounds like what happens when punks take the same rage they had in the \u201990s, lace it with paranoia, and hotbox it until their minds start to melt away. The dual-vocal assault hits you like a fistfight in a dirty basement stairwell, the guitars grind and wobble like someone recorded them inside a smoke-clouded garage, and the drums keep everything lurching forward, even when the whole thing feels like it might wander off to stare at tree branches for a minute. It\u2019s still punk as hell, but with a baked edge that gives the whole release a disoriented charm. A perfect soundtrack for getting high and getting pissed-off at the same time. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Shock to the System Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Stiff Nights Like a Rat / Summertime 7\u2033 Call \u2018em \u201cZZ BOTTOM\u201d\u2014STIFF NIGHTS are some strangely-inspired dudes from Tennessee playing punky, glam-infused, stripped-down Southern rock jams. Rather than go for speed, they let the songs linger, with both sides of the 45 allowing enough time to slam one beer down and crack another. By the time the purple/pink vinyl stops spinning, you\u2019ve got a decent buzz going and you\u2019re headed to the saloon for an evening of debauchery. You might even wake up the next morning \u201ccoyote\u201d style, as the old legend goes: head throbbing, spooning with a mystery monster, and faced with the unfortunate dilemma of having to chew your own arm off to escape undetected. Reviewer Jason Harding Label WereOpossum Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Unidad Ideologica Choque Asim\u00e9trico LP A crushing statement of militant hardcore punk rooted in confrontation and discipline. UNIDAD IDEOL\u00d3GICA delivers rigid, marching riffs and commanding vocals that sound built for the street and the barricade. Lyrically and sonically uncompromising, the record channels organized anger rather than chaos, drawing power from clarity and ideological focus. Choque Asim\u00e9trico feels like a call to resist, positioning hardcore punk as a tool of conflict rather than escape. One of the most forceful and politically charged releases of the moment. Una declaraci\u00f3n aplastante de hardcore punk militante, basada en la confrontaci\u00f3n y la disciplina. UNIDAD IDEOL\u00d3GICA presentan riffs r\u00edgidos y marciales junto a voces autoritarias, pensadas para la calle y la barricada. Sin concesiones en lo l\u00edrico ni en lo sonoro, el disco canaliza bronca organizada en lugar de caos, apoy\u00e1ndose en la claridad y el enfoque ideol\u00f3gico. Choque Asim\u00e9trico funciona como un llamado a resistir. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label La Vida Es Un Mus Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 AOA / Oi Polloi Unlimited Genocide split LP reissue Fuck me, although I feel like we\u2019re barely in autumn, it is actually past Christmastime already, and for the consumerist nightmare it always entails, Santa might have been in a punk rock phase last year, because I got assigned a genuine UK anarcho-punk classic for review: the Unlimited Genocide split LP between AOA and OI POLLOI from Scotland. Originally released in 1986 on Children of the Revolution, it has remained a largely unsung classic and has finally gotten the proper reissue treatment thanks to Sealed Records, which we all should be thankful for. Although not the biggest name in the hardest-hitting anarcho-punk school of the \u201980s (being Scottish may sadly not have helped in a very London-centric scene), AOA recorded three crucial\u2014and hard-to-find, obviously\u2014records during their run, and this is the second one. Being a sucker for the genre, I have been a massive fan since I first heard them through a wise punk elder. AOA has often been described as furious, and the attribute is well-deserved. Fast-paced, angry, DISCHARGE-inspired political hardcore punk, just before the rise of UK crust and the metal invasion. I am heavily reminded of cult bands like ANTISECT or ANTI-SYSTEM, but I\u2019d argue that the Scots may have given more than a passing listen to the ICONOCLAST as well. On the other side, we have the much more famous and iconic anarcho band OI POLLOI, who everyone knows at least by name and is able to sing along to \u201cPunx Picnic.\u201d I guess you could say that, despite a certain status and popularity, we don\u2019t really explore the band\u2019s long discography critically, and their side of the split documents them at a time when they still partook in anthemic, if a bit cheesy, rough anarcho Oi! (like on the split with BETRAYED), but also embracing the faster and more abrasive anarcho-punk philosophy in terms of sound (like on the TOXIK EPHEX one)\u2014like any sane punk would have done, really. What\u2019s great with OI POLLOI is that you can instantly recognize Deek\u2019s very distinctive vocals, so you always know where you stand. The songs here are mostly fast, but the band also slows things down, remaining heavy and threatening. I forgot how great these songs were, very reminiscent of ICONS OF FILTH, CONFLICT, or even ANTISECT, and it\u2019s got my favourite of theirs, \u201cThe Only Release.\u201d A great record that tackled political issues that are sadly as relevant as ever today. Essential stuff. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Sealed Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Cemento Bad Dream Songs LP CEMENTO out of Los Angeles has been compiling a library of goth-inspired post-punk epics for the past few years, and many of those tracks appear on their fresh full-length entitled Bad Dream Songs . Produced in conjunction with Iron Lung Records, CEMENTO\u2019s sound is pushed to a monolithic depth on Bad Dream Songs , allowing the band to fully exhibit their artistry. If you were into Sacred Bones\u2019 release of the HUNT\u2019s The Hunt Begins in 2013, or if you\u2019re into things like the early works of the CULT and CHRISTIAN DEATH, then you should check out Bad Dream Songs . Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 DSM-5 / Varoitus \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland Jawbreaker split LP A crushing split LP pairing two distinct but equally bleak visions of modern hardcore. DSM-5 delivers suffocating, noise-laced hardcore punk that feels mentally claustrophobic, with repetitive riffs and desperate vocals mirroring psychological collapse. VAROITUS counters with cold Finnish D-beat, sharp and militant, channeling classic Scandinavian hardcore with a contemporary sense of urgency. A relentless record that leaves no room for comfort. Un split LP demoledor que une dos visiones distintas pero igualmente sombr\u00edas del hardcore actual. DSM-5 presenta un hardcore punk asfixiante y cargado de ruido, con riffs repetitivos y voces desesperadas que reflejan un colapso mental constante. VAROITUS responde con D-beat finland\u00e9s fr\u00edo y militante, afilado y urgente, heredero directo del hardcore escandinavo cl\u00e1sico. Un disco implacable, sin concesiones. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Phobia Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Emmett O.C. 9 From the Warped Mind LP First solo project from Emmett O\u2019Connor (ARCHIE AND THE BUNKERS, MK ULTRAS) out of Cleveland. Inside this warped mind, we find bedroom synth punk complete with drum machine, warbling lead lines, and earnest, droning vocals, like on \u201cPieces of My Life\u201d where O\u2019Connor croons \u201cLike a shining light from up above / She came down and she gave me her love.\u201d \u201cBurger King From My Dreams\u201d gets a little sillier, and brings to mind the Technics organ tone of WESLEY WILLIS, with shades of \u201cRock n Roll McDonalds\u201d to boot. On \u201cThe Air Conditioning is Making Me Sick\u201d he gets a little heavier, channeling some BABY TYLER or maybe ALIEN NOSEJOB with a mock seriousness. \u201cCurtain Call\u201d plays that wobbly organ again, with some doo wop in place of the drum machine, which maybe leads us to his \u201950s rocker/James Dean influence displayed on the album cover? Layer all these things together, and I find myself thrown for a complete loop. Yet here I am, enjoying 9 From the Warped Mind quite a darn bit. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Sweet Time Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Fin Dystopia cassette Six-song debut cassette from Middle Tennessee. At first I thought FIN sounded like an alt-rock-leaning indie band, but after further observation, I now believe they sound like an indie-leaning alt-rock band. Might sound like a nominal distinction, but I stand by it, with the difference-maker being production quality. This debut cassette is self-recorded by the band and has a bit of grit to it. The obvious cue to me came with the last song, \u201cTalk Too Much,\u201d a repetitive grunge number which truly sounded to me like it could have been a reworked NIRVANA song. Any way you cut it, FIN seems to dabble in a lot of \u201990s throwback genres, so if the \u201990s are your thing, snag yourself one of the 25 copies of this tape before you miss out. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Tennessee Cold Cuts Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Gape Reduced to Nothing EP Minimal and direct. Los Angeles-based GAPE opens with a blast of do-or-die hardcore energy. Eight tracks, just over ten minutes in total, and absolutely no filler. From the opening notes of \u201cWest Co.\u201d to the closing \u201cSeasons,\u201d the band delivers the kind of short, sharp, unforgiving intensity that hardcore was built for: fast tempos, fast riffs, and riot-inducing shouting. The record never lets up, exactly what you want from a 7\u2033 when you feel like you need to rip the world a new one. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Leti Y Los Utensilios Fuego EP Debut EP from LETI Y LOS UTENSILIOS from Madrid, Spain. Four songs of dark, brooding punk with driving bass that grounds a razorblade guitar, cymbal-crashing drums, and a female vocalist with plenty of bite. \u201cFuego\u201d and \u201cSubir Bajar\u201d on the A-side hit pretty hard and chug right along, while the B-side\u2019s \u201cHaloperidol\u201d and \u201cBotox\u201d fall into a bit more of a garage groove, with some guitar solos and riffing. Overall, this is a great debut, and I\u2019ll be excited to see where they go from here. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Delia Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Night Court Nervous Birds! LP Vancouver\u2019s NIGHT COURT is back with a remastered reissue of their first two releases, ( Nervous Birds! One and Nervous Birds! Too ) on one LP. NIGHT COURT plays lo-fi garage pop that leans more toward the dirt pop spectrum than garage punk. It\u2019s straightforward, sometimes jangly, and there\u2019s a pop element throughout. The lyrics are audible and intelligent, full of pop culture references, wasted nights, and sarcasm, and often delivered via dual vocalists. \u201cSurfin Iona\u201d is a standout for me, with drummer Emilor taking the lead and sounding like a bizarro version of Kate Pierson of the B-52\u2019S. There\u2019s a line from the song \u201cYr Ride\u201d that stuck with me after a few listens: \u201cDeath is a hard ride / Heaven\u2019s a joyride / Until you get caught with your pants down.\u201d If there\u2019s a heaven, I certainly want to arrive bare-assed! For someone with zero attention span, 26 songs is a lot to digest at once. I get why these were originally separate releases, but existing fans will love having these in all one place and on vinyl for the first time. It\u2019s a cool showcase of the band\u2019s early output, and fans of bands like MARKED MEN or even early SHINS will find something to love. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Debt Offensive / Drunk Dial / Shield / Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Pill Mill Trimming the Fat EP British Columbia\u2019s PILL MILL deliver the goods on their debut EP, a speedy hardcore punk attack bursting at the seams with the same frantic energy that the X-Claim! roster excelled at. Turbo-charged riffs, manically paced drum fills, and distorted, sneering vocals ensure every box is checked, putting this in league with Neon Taste labelmates CHAIN WHIP and SSIK (with whom the band shares members). Highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Neon Taste Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Screensaver Three Lens Approach LP SCREENSAVER out of Melbourne has been pumping out material for the past six years, and on their latest full-length Three Lens Approach , they invite us to a gothic synth punk dub party that has us dancing to the unexpected shifts between DEVO-ish rhythms to more melancholic \u201cDeath Disco\u201d inspirations. Multiple synthesizers fire off as hard-hitting bass lines and fierce guitar licks create an immersive atmosphere, while Krystal Maynard\u2019s vocals are charged and velvety. Occasionally I\u2019m reminded of things like the EPOXIES or CRASH COURSE IN SCIENCE, but SCREENSAVER is definitely carving out a sound that is uniquely their own. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Poison City Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Serial Pest Living in Fear cassette Pure knuckle-dragging Aussie hardcore, with zero mercy. Living In Fear rips with frantic drums, guitar tone straight out of a damp squat, and vocals that sound like someone screaming through a wall of cigarette smoke. Everything here is fast, mean, and gloriously ugly. SERIAL PEST doesn\u2019t bother with anything resembling restraint, just wild, swinging chaos and fist-in-the-air rage. Feels less like a recording and more like stumbling into the wrong backyard show and getting shoved straight into the pit. If you want thrashy hardcore that bites, spits, and leaves the room smelling worse than when it started, this is it. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Noise Merchant Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Shop Talk Museum of Sex / Gaslight 7\u2033 Solid two-song slab from this Brooklyn trio. Power pop with a little bit of a street punk edge, kind of like a beefier EXPLODING HEARTS/BUZZCOCKS concoction. Laden with earworm vocals and catchy guitar work, this pair of tracks goes by way too quickly. I want more, dammit! Really lovely work here. Add this to your winter playlist to combat your S.A.D. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label One Track Mind Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Sikphuxz Punk is Shit EP Formed in Victoria, BC in 1979, SIKPHUXZ was the first effort from Murray \u201cThe Cretin\u201d Acton, who would later go on to assemble the legendary DAYGLO ABORTIONS. Though there were no official releases from these early Canadian punks, they did record a handful of tracks that have been unearthed and remastered on this archival EP that comes with extensive liner notes and photos. The roots of Murray\u2019s trademark irreverence are on display here in songs like the title track and \u201cI\u2019m So Dumb,\u201d alongside more straightforward punk tunes like \u201cLet\u2019s Run Away\u201d and \u201cP.O.W.,\u201d offering an interesting glimpse of history. It\u2019s a cool little package, and the DAYGLO guys are still going strong today, with members having been arrested on drug charges as recently as fall of last year. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Supreme Echo Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Abism Barbie Terminator EP Right before the first time I heard ABISM\u2019s new 7\u201d, I\u2019d just finished jamming a live boot of the VELVET UNDERGROUND, and I was amazed by the freedom of the faded guitar pokes and messing around, demonstrating how bravely primitive and self-conscious they were (and which I guess is the essence of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, to be a confident dilettante). This feeling probably stuck with me when \u201cBarbie Terminator\u201d kicked in with its cacophonic guitar scraping and burst of pumping beats that meticulously, or by instinct, are set to a tempo that grabs attention and moves bodies. Then by the second song, the fuzzed guitars started playing notes that are weird, not too technically difficult but remarkable when paired with confidence and taste, because fuck it\u2014some of us do mess around with such ideas at odd hours of the day under odd circumstances and wonder whether it is okay to include them even in radikal punk songs. ABISM\u2019s new record is a straight \u201cfuck you\u201d to those thoughts, because this sounds great and it fits a hardcore song. Only four rudimental hardcore tracks reflecting the universal frame of many signature scenes\u2019 sound, with a wink to those roots that make the record sound simple and original, and which combined recall dozens of the best bands without referencing any of them. This balance is the challenge of sounding original nowadays after everybody has heard everything and still ever-wanting more of this raw power. Another highly confident \u201cfuck you\u201d is the riff of \u201cFly Away\u201d\u2026you have a four-song 7\u201d, and you dedicate a significant amount of time to summon LENNY KRAVITZ in the subconscious of your listeners? That is bold. But even the realization of this bizarre thing is not able to keep me from loving this record. I love the non-stop pogo beat and tight groove that delivers all the weird and cool guitar sounds, and the best raspy voice (familiar from the amazing GARRAPATA). Reviewer Viktor Vargyai Label Toxic State Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Atol Atol Atol Dron Dron Dron LP ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s 2023 LP Koniec Sosu Tysi\u0105ca Wysp completely threw me for a loop\u2014taut, twin-vocal Polish art-punk with a minor DOG FACED HERMANS fixation? I might as well be Pavlov\u2019s dog. Follow-up Dron Dron Dron is just as mind-warping, centering the band\u2019s anxious electronic textures and snap-tight rhythms like an alternate-timeline Hardcore -era DEVO that wound up on Ron Johnson Records alongside the EX and BIG FLAME. Opener \u201cNeon\u201d is a perfect example of the band\u2019s controlled chaos, locking straight into a staccato, mechanical groove with skittering guitar, a bass line bouncing everywhere like an errant rubber Superball, and doubled-up chants from vocalists \u0141ukasz and Agata, all of which could be panic-inducing (or just irritating) in lesser hands, but it\u2019s completely hypnotic here. Likewise, the densely knotted skronk of \u201cBlok\u201d might easily tip into prog-punk territory were it not for some wild, collapsing drum breakdowns, but when the frenetic call-and-response in \u201cP\u0142ytki Sen\u201d hits against some incessantly buzzing synth and treble-maxed guitar cutting in like the quickest of knife flicks, there\u2019s no question that ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s true objective is putting the damage back in \u201cart-damaged,\u201d and they\u2019re killing it.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Destroyer :: Destroyer's Rubies Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric.

And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together In 1976 the granola jazzists teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in the sphere, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Gary Peacock/Ralph Towner :: Oracle Posted on January 27, 2026 January 25, 2026 The recently reissued Oracle , a collaboration between bassist Gary Peacock and recently deceased guitarist Ralph Towner gives us a look at two legends in deep midcareer. Originally released in 1995, it shows two restless musicians, each with their own highly developed, distinct musical language, looking to mix things up. Though more Peacock-forward, its seamless mix of carefully spontaneous playing and freewheeling composition serves as a fitting farewell to Towner, and reminds us that the great ones never stop evolving, long after their so-called \u201cclassic\u201d eras have ended. The Disassociation :: Losing Is A Luxury Posted on January 27, 2026 January 25, 2026 From the mysterious expanses of southern California\u2019s Inland Empire emerges \u2026 The Disassociation! This new group is a powerful joining of forces, an impressive melding of minds, bringing together long-running lo-fi indie pioneers Refrigerator (a band that today continues to be underrated, even by the cognoscenti), Amy Maloof of Falcon Eddy, artist/musician/DJ Sam Sousa, and the brilliant author Jonathan Lethem. Winged Wheel :: Desert So Green Posted on January 26, 2026 January 25, 2026 Winged Wheel\u2019s third LP, Desert So Green , shows off this imaginative and evolving approach with terrific results. Though certain elements remain in place, the dream team sextet (Whitney Johnson, Cory Plump, Matthew J. Rolin, Steve Shelley, Lonnie Slack and Fred Thomas) seem intent on not making the same record twice. Pullman :: III Posted on January 26, 2026 January 24, 2026 This third album from the ambient folk-blues supergroup Pullman explores the connection between memory and physical frailty, finding musical communion amid loss. It\u2019s a quiet, emotionally charged gift, letting long-time member and early onset Alzheimers sufferer Tim Barnes make the most of his limited remaining time on earth. The Lagniappe Sessions :: The Slaps Posted on January 23, 2026 January 22, 2026 Via Chicago, guitarist Rand Kelly, bassist Ramsey Bell, and drummer Josh Resing are The Slaps. Formed in 2017, the genre agnostic trio are constantly in motion, and, more impressively, consistently interesting. This installment of the Lagniappe Sessions finds the band paying tribute to pre- Dark Side era Floyd with a lived-in, and woolly, cover of Obscured by Clouds\u2019 \u201cWot\u2019s\u2026 Uh the Deal\u201d. AD Manna, indeed! And keeping things local, they deliver an amped up version of friend and touring partner hemlock\u2019s \u201cUnder All The Kudzu\u201d \u2026 Evelyne/Maseo :: Testpattern Posted on January 22, 2026 January 21, 2026 Fusing elements of Japanese City Pop, French New Wave, and a touch of Kosmische Musik, Testpattern by Evelyne/Maseo is sonically sublime. Recorded in Maseo Hiruma\u2019s home studio circa mid-80s, the material hits as well as anything coming out of the renowned Yen Records at the time. Fans of Yellow Magic Orchestra are legion, and this recently unearthed addition to the golden era of Japanese electronic music will delight any YMO junkie. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on January 21, 2026 January 19, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Herbie Hancock Septet: Live at the Boardinghouse January 16, 1973 Posted on January 21, 2026 January 21, 2026 Recently, a previously unheard Sextant tour FM broadcast from SF\u2019s legendary Boarding House emerged. It\u2019s well worth your time. This group is especially good when they stretch way way way out. And they certainly do that here: most of the performance is made up of a 40+ minute spiral through \u201cHidden Shadows.\u201d Everyone gets a chance to shine, of course, but let\u2019s give it up for the rhythm section of Buster Williams and Billy Hart, who hold things down and lift things up simultaneously, letting the prog-funk-jazz mutant grooves spin and swirl all around the room. Unreal! Barry Walker, Jr. :: Paleo Sol Posted on January 21, 2026 January 20, 2026 Pedal steel guitarist Barry Walker, Jr. has long spun out his unearthly twangs for rustic psychedelicists like Mouth Painter, North Americans and the Rose City Band. The lingering, shape-shifting overtones that float from his instrument imbue an instant mystery and ambiguity. He puts the \u201ccosmic\u201d in \u201ccosmic country.\u201d Now on this solo album\u2014accompanied by drummer Rob Smith from Animal, Surrender! and Jason Willmon from Mouth Painter\u2014he puts his ineffable sound at center stage, in songs that traverse drone, Americana and Reichian minimalism. The Olympians :: Strawberry Kiwi Posted on January 20, 2026 January 19, 2026 Sometimes things just take time. It\u2019s been a whole decade since The Olympians, the orchestral funk and soul combo led by songwriter Toby Pazner (Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, El Michels Affair) dropped their self-titled debut on Daptone Records. But 2026 sees the group\u2019s long awaited return with In Search of a Revival , due out February 13th on Daptone. Jana Horn :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on January 20, 2026 January 19, 2026 Over the last few years, and now three records, Jana Horn has quietly asserted herself as a songwriter of great merit amongst a vast and seemingly bottomless sea of artists also in search of answers through song. Her most recent LP, a self-titled work written during a period of transition in her life\u2014notably a relocation to New York City having graduated from a writing program in the University of Virginia\u2014captures movement not just in the physical sense of moving from one physical place to another, but of progressing the flow of her interior life. Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo Posted on January 19, 2026 January 19, 2026 In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Mean Red Spiders :: Starsandsons Posted on January 19, 2026 January 19, 2026 Toronto\u2019s Mean Red Spiders released their opus, Starsandsons , in 2000, to little lasting acclaim. On the one hand, the album came too late \u2013 their psychedelic, arty sensibilities were out of sync with the changing tides. On the other hand, it was too early \u2013 critics and fans didn\u2019t have the right language to fully grok what the Mean Red Spiders were on about. But as contemporary \u201cshoegaze\u201d and \u201cdreampop\u201d bands have mined the \u201890s aesthetic for their own sound, it\u2019s given us a newfound appreciation for some overlooked classics, and Starsandsons is ready for a reappraisal.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
