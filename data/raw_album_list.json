Facebook Instagram RSS Twitter Powered by Genesis Sophie Gault \u2013 Unhinged Thursday, January 15, 2026 By Shawn Underwood Somewhere in the exurbs of farming country sits the rural version of a night club. It\u2019s a big, corrugated tin building with a puddle-filled gravel lot, nearly indistinguishable from the welding shop next door.

Others show up like somebody finding an old Polaroid in a jacket pocket and realizing: oh right, this is who we were. Holy Cross Blues is that second kind. It doesn\u2019t feel \u201cnew\u201d in the trendy sense. It feels newly revealed.

Everyone\u2019s vote counts the same, although Mayer\u2019s should probably count double since he consumes more music than anyone I know. On the other hand, my taste is better.

Now, consider that this entire album was composed by one person. Perhaps the greatest compliment I can offer is how fluid it runs through these varied landscapes. Oblivisci Outlying A vocal dilemma that I took seriously. Purgartory Phasma Controlled chaos is what I call the album. It teeters on the very edge of the precipice of just falling over into the black hole and disappearing forever, but somehow the band manages to maintain control. Much of the music is weighted, aggressive, and intricate, and the vocals reign down continually like a storm of fists on your head. It\u2019s a very disturbing death\u2026the kind that ends completely bloody. How can you control something that is literally out of control? Ask PHASMA. Dancing With Ther Devil Lynch Mob \"Dancing With The Devil\", is the farewell album from legendary guitarist George Lynch and Lynch [\u2026] Symbiotic Dream Black Pig Meat Overall, this was just a fun album to listen to. It undulates with a free flowing rhythm and the band is never out of step. Indeed, they play like seasons veterans, and although it does explore the landscape well, it is never too far off the path. For me, it\u2019s the kind of album you can just put on and let it ride. The Bereaved Marianas Rest \u201cChanneling deep melancholy\u201d is about as good of a descriptor as I can think of to describe the album. The depth of that melancholy seems to travel to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, and stays there forever, lost and forgotten by the sands of time. Right Here, Right Now Our Oceans From the gorgeous album cover, to the lovely words on the song-by-song sheet, Our Oceans have developed an aesthetic of their own. Quan tot s\u2019apagui Syberia Sometimes, the level of weight and emotionally crushing tones are so close to overwhelming you, you almost want to stop the music in its tracks. At other times, they beg you to stop and look around, taking in as many things that might tickle your senses as possible. Each layer of this music is just so easy to peel though, and I find more discoveries with each listen. This World We Live In... Cryoxyd Alright, this one took me a little while to get into. Silhouettes Violet Although the EP only had five studio tracks, you can chart the band\u2019s progress from earlier work to now, and they really hit their stride here on this album. It\u2019s catchy, fun, energetic, and they know how to deliver a chorus, fresh and ready. Life is just a phase Seven Blood Life is Just a Phase\u00a0is the debut LP of German metal band\u00a0Seven Blood,\u00a0and it's an [\u2026] Koulemankello Perkeet Like I needed to get into another band whose name I can\u2019t come close to pronouncing correctly much less spell. Ill-Gotten Gains Aittala \u201cIll-Gotten Gains\u201d is an EP for our times. Radici Diespnea This album is largely a study in contrasts. Just when you think the sound is settling, it jars into another direction. It isn\u2019t typical of the FWOBM or even the SWOBM\u2026instead, it\u2019s experimental, with outstanding musicianship, far reaching, visionary, and pleasing in the oddest sort of way. Sounds Of Malice Redivider As this is as Death Metal as music can get, the emphasis can now shift unto how and what REDIVIDER are bringing on \u201cSounds Of Malice\u201d. Well, let me start by saying that the production of this album is without fault. It is hard, it is Heavy, but it also is transparent and very clear, making sure that you are able to hear what the band wants you to hear. Sinister Resurrection of the Morbid Adetar Bloody Hell, this does take me back some years, or should I say eons? I remember ADETAR from the early nineties, as they hail from ENSCHEDE in my home country, and I not only saw them live, I also booked them at our youth centre at the time. Origin Another Realm I don't remember symphonic prog being this unexciting... Gods Don\u2019t Take Calls Walk In Darkness WALK IN DARKNESS offer a blend of symphonic and melodic Metal with Gothic twists. Symphonic/melodic Metal fans, who like it dark and slow will enjoy their new album Shadow Work Despised Icon \u201cShadow Work\u201d goes beyond classical Deathcore and moves boundaries with Hardcore twists and Death Metal vibes being evident in many of the album songs Killkarma SELIAS Phew! A BIG slice of modern melodeath! Melody Autumns Child Mickael Erlandson is a man who needs no further introduction to Melodic Rock. He has [\u2026] Mothers Drowned In Silver I have to say is that although this goes way beyond that which I\u2019m used to listening, I found myself being utterly intrigued and, in this case, even mesmerised by what I hear on \u201cMothers\u201d. Even though the songs are quite lengthy, DROWNED IN SILVER never gives you the feeling that they are too long. Songs Of The Hungry Ghosts Harmozel HARMOZEL doesn\u2019t have a record deal, so the thing to do is to self-release the debut album \u201cSongs Of The Hungry Ghosts\u201d. And what is very clear from the start is yes, this is Doom Metal. There is no way you can confuse this for anything else. Rise Of The Immortals Hounds HOUNDS are an Italian Heavy/US Power Metal band born in 2016. Their music is mainly inspired by the great masters of Heavy Metal and 80s US Power Metal, including JUDAS PRIEST, SAVATAGE and VIRGIN STEELE. Well, if that doesn\u2019t sound promising, I don\u2019t know what does. Old Night - Mediterranean Melancholy Old Night The songs are clearly written and recorded by a band that has been together for quite some time. Everything on \u201cMediterranean Melancholy\u201d is rather lengthy, but not once are you wondering when the song is going to end. There are no boring pieces, you will hear no fillers being used by OLD NIGHT, be it short or long. We Are One (single) Rozario Heavy metal rockers ROZARIO return with the second single/video from their upcoming album \u201cNorthern Crusaders\u201d  and promise to keep the \u201cNorthern Crusade\u201d rampaging. Life in Seven Dreams Laughing Stock I mentioned that the album seems to be more about exploring the journey than arriving at any destination. Certain Progressive Rock music features subtle complexities that may challenge even seasoned listeners. I found the material here to be reflective of that. It might be one of the best features of the genre however\u2026that sense of mystery and having to peel back the layers to find what\u2019s underneath. Rituals of a Dying Light Deadwood A short but sweet slice of Blackened (?) Deathcore. Abyss - The Final Chapter Annisokay Abyss - The Final Chapter, \u00a0the latest album by German metalcore outfit\u00a0Annisokay,\u00a0rips clean through the [\u2026] Reborn Through Torture Calcraft This was an excellent album, and it veered off of the path of the genre just enough to keep it intriguing. They used harrowing backing elements, some clean vocals and spoken words, and other techniques and by the end, I did feel like it was a soundtrack to the final scene of a movie that I would never survive. War Chariots White Baroness Overall, this wasn\u2019t a bad album by any stretch, it just didn\u2019t offer anything new to the genre. Purists might like this album because it stays within the traditions of the genre, but I like to hear bands taking more chances and experimenting more with their music. We Are Him Darvaza The album seemed to improve the longer I listened to it and with each forthcoming song. I also appreciated the religious themes within the music. Indeed, Black Metal was founded on religion\u2026anti-religion of course. This was a solid effort from the duo. Joker In The Pack Hell In The Club After signing to Frontiers Records in 2017, Hell in the Club released \u201cHell Of Fame\u201d [\u2026] Reactance Theory D'Ercole Listening to \u201cReactance Theory\u201d is also making me a very happy Rocker because the songs all have that little bit of class that you expect from a band that has been going for some 15 years, making it even more remarkable that they have been able to produce 11 albums, including this one. Time Skull & Crossbones Opening tune \u201cEchoes of Eternity\u201d goes from 0 to 100 mph in just a few seconds. And let me tell you, if this song doesn\u2019t do it for you, just ignore the rest of the album. Cybergenesis HyperioN HYPERION isn\u2019t the next band to take over the world, but they are a band that has the ability to please and entertain a lot of (mostly) old fashioned Metal fans with the music they have provided us with on \u201cCybergenesis\u201d. And because they have been able to provide the record with a very clear, transparent, but above all contemporary sound, a lot of the young Metal afficionados might be quite willing to not only give this a go, but also their sign of approval.

This new collection of songs will serve as the band's first studio album since 2017's One More Light, which came out just two months prior to the death of Chester Bennington . The tragedy left the future of the band in limbo and a big void in the heavy music world. After seven years of silence, Linkin Park returned in early September with the song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and an intimate performance in Los Angeles, both of which revealed Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara as their new co-vocalist alongside Mike Shinoda . They also shared a handful of 2024 tour dates and details about From Zero. The record will be out in just two days, and fans will be able to fully take in what Linkin Park have been working on over the last several years. We went through a couple of reviews of the album and pieced together some interesting tidbits that you can check out below. READ MORE: Venues Begin Teasing Linkin Park Tour by Posting Photos Here's what the reviews are saying about Linkin Park's From Zero. The album will be out Nov. 15. It's 'Not the Best Linkin Park Album of All Time' Linkin Park have created some masterpieces during their career, especially their earliest albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. It's almost impossible for any band to top their best releases, and according to Kerrang! , From Zero didn't take the cake. However, the publication noted something important \u2014 \"it doesn\u2019t have to be\" their best album. It signifies a rebirth of the band rather than a competition with their past. The review, which gave the record four out of five stars, also asserts that \"Casualty\" ( which they recently debuted live ) is, in fact, one of the heaviest songs of their career. The piece concludes, \"...as a piece of work, it\u2019s a clear reminder of why Linkin Park reached the heights they did and continue to influence multiple generations of artists. Welcome back.\" There Is Some Talking Laced Throughout It When the rockers played \"Casualty\" live for the first time last week, Shinoda said to the crowd, \"Dallas gets to find out what happens when Em puts her screaming pants on.\" This was apparently a reference to something that is actually said on the record, according to The Guardian . \"...a male voice urges her to 'get your screaming pants on' \u2013 one of the recordings of studio chat that scatter the album,\" the review reads, suggesting that there are voices that help set the stage for\u00a0other parts of the record. The Guardian also gave From Zero four stars, and finishes with the sentiment, \"They were always unafraid to take sonic risks, and another sonic risk is exactly what their comeback constitutes \u2013 one that has handsomely paid off.\" 'From Zero' is a Vocal Harmony The eponymous opening track is apparently a 22-second vocal harmony between Shinoda and Armstrong, according to Metal Injection . They noted that it sounds reminiscent of The Beach Boys'\u00a0\"Our Prayer\u201d or Big Big Trains' \"Evening Star.\u201d The article closes with, \"Put another way, listeners who approach From Zero with an unbiased and welcoming mind will find that it's a triumphant return from one of the biggest rock bands of the last 25 years.\" One of the Tracks Sound Similar to 'Bleed It Out' Several publications noted that the song \"Cut the Bridge\" sounds similar to their Minutes to Midnight hit \"Bleed It Out.\" Rock Cellar Magazine called the track \"notable as an attempt at a 'Bleed It Out 2.0,'\" and the aforementioned Metal Injection piece suggested the same. The Guardian also teased that there is a moment in the song where Armstrong's voice is is left along without any music behind it, putting an emphasis on her vocal abilities. There are, of course, other comparisons between songs that argue that some of the new material could have fit on Hybrid Theory or Meteora, but this is something fans have been saying since \"The Emptiness Machine\" and \"Heavy Is the Crown\" came out. It Ends With a Ballad Another shared sentiment between the reviews listed above is that \"Good Things Go,\" the album's closer, is a powerful ballad. Metal Injection described it as \"an immensely epic and impactful closer,\" whereas Rock Cellar Magazine stated that Linkin Park often end albums on a strong note, and compared it to Living Things' \"Powerless\" and The Hunting Party's \"Final Masquerade.\" While each review had its own take on the record, the majority of them seem to agree that it's a solid piece of work all the way through, and has a high potential of being one of the year's best.

Grand Theft Auto V Nov 18, 2014 \u2022 Rated M The sprawling sun-soaked metropolis of Los Santos is chock full of self-help coaches, starlets and C-List celebrities, once on top of the media world, now struggling to stay relevant in time of economic malaise and lowest-common-denominator reality TV.

Half-Life 2 Nov 16, 2004 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2004 PC Game of the Year]  By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- are counting on him. [Vivendi Universal] 96 Metascore 17. BioShock Aug 21, 2007 \u2022 Rated M [Metacritic's 2007 Xbox 360 Game of the Year] Going beyond \"run and gun corridors,\" \"monster-closet AIs\" and static worlds, BioShock creates a living, unique and unpredictable FPS experience. After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture, a city hidden beneath the sea.

Take control of your world by hacking mechanical devices, commandeering security turrets and crafting unique items critical to your very survival. Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels, explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment. Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations scattered throughout the city, empowering you with fantastic and often grotesque abilities. Explore a living world powered by Ecological A.I., where the inhabitants have interesting and consequential relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience. Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city, highlighted by the most detailed and realistic water effects ever developed in a video game. Make meaningful choices and mature decisions, ultimately culminating in the grand question: do you exploit the innocent survivors of Rapture...or save them? [2K Games] 96 Metascore 18.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Soen \u2013 Reliance Review By Dolphin Whisperer on January 16, 2026 in Reviews , Progressive Rock , 84 comments \u201cAt their very best, the Sweden-by-way-of-globetrotting Soen has produced music ranging from forlorn and mystical to organ-blaring and heart-wrenching. While we often talk about progressive music in terms of its tendency for extravagance and meticulous detail, we skip that many of these artists iterate around ideas that lean insular and lacking broad appeal. By its many definitions, this recontextualizing of rock music has sought to express even more directly the hopes of its creators at whatever cost. But in that pool, bands like Soen have attempted both to attack with this personal expression, in the frenetic footwork of Martin Lopez (ex- Opeth ) and the lilting mic mastery of Joel Ekel\u00c3\u00b6f, and lay barbed chorus with these same tools.\u201d Only rely on your best weapons. The Eternal \u2013 Celestial Review By Steel Druhm on January 16, 2026 in Reviews , 33 comments \u201cAustralian Gothic doom act The Eternal came into my life with their 2018 opus Waiting for the Endless Dawn and caused me much consternation. I loved their depressive Paradise Lost / Sentenced / Katatonia style, but struggled with the sheer length of the compositions, which ranged from 10 minutes upward to 20. I underscored the album despite some amazing material due to its sheer size, and I regret that still. 2024s Skinwalker saw them tone down the running times somewhat, and it was another glum victory with huge moments of sadboi glory. Now The Eternal drop a mini-album/EP named Celestial , and lo and behold, it\u2019s economical in size and scope.\u201d Tears in the eternal void. Carrion Vael \u2013 Slay Utterly Review By Grin Reaper on January 15, 2026 in Reviews , Melodic Death Metal , Technical Death Metal , 62 comments \u201c Carrion Vael has cultivated an admirably consistent release schedule since dropping Resurrection of the Doomed in 2017. After unleashing follow-up God Killer in 2020, the Richmond, Indiana quintet has delivered big, veiny doses of muscular, technical melodeath every other year. Slay Utterly is Carrion Vael \u2019s fifth load of unfettered aggression, slinging riffs that sparkle and crush in whiplashing frenzies. Though not explicitly billed as a concept album, Slay Utterly delves into tales morbid and macabre.\u201d Carrion, my wayward son. HyperioN (IT) \u2013 Cybergenesis Review By Spicie Forrest on January 15, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , 25 comments \u201cFormed in Bologna, Italy, HyperioN has been kicking around since 2015. When they visited these halls in 2017, Eldritch Elitist called their debut, Dangerous Days , \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe strongest 3.0 possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d citing its ability to \u00e2\u0080\u009ceffortlessly [inject] elements of trash and power metal into the proceedings\u00e2\u0080\u009d and its \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant room for future growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d HyperioN returns now in 2026 with their third full-length, Cybergenesis , a concept album chronicling an interdimensional war, humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enslavement, and their eventual rebellion and liberation.\u201d Start the cyber. Kreator \u2013 Krushers of the World Review By Steel Druhm on January 14, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Thrash Metal , 110 comments \u201cWe\u2019re in the honeymoon phase of our shiny new year, and over the next few weeks, some big names will be dropping albums to set the tone for this trip around the Sun. First up is Kreator , Germany\u2019s long-running and legendary thrash institution, with their 16th album, Krushers of the World . So which version of Kreator are we getting here? The straight-up, no-bullshit thrashers, or the ones that stir traditional metal sounds into the expected speed for a more polished brew?\u201d Painting with a broad krush. Unexpectance \u2013 Solus Ipse By Kenstrosity on January 14, 2026 in Reviews , Melodic Death Metal , Metalcore , 41 comments \u201cSpanish metalcore/melodeath quintet Unexpectance lived up to their name when I encountered them for the first time in 2022, boasting a remarkably meaty and riff-packed assault on their sophomore effort Vortex . After recruiting a new drummer, a new vocalist, and a new lead guitarist, their upcoming salvo Solus Ipse threatens to sound quite a bit different, despite tapping similar Dante-centric philosophical wells for its theme. This potential shift didn\u2019t hamper my interest, however, as their chunky, groovy songwriting held up quite well over time.\u201d No one expects the unexpectance. The Ruins of Beverast \u2013 Tempelschlaf Review By Dear Hollow on January 13, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Metal , Doom Metal , 105 comments \u201c The Ruins of Beverast has never released a bad album. Its architect, Nagelfar alum Alexander von Meilenwald, has both a devotion to the trve and old-school as well as a flexibility to experiment, creating a legendary discography that feels like a natural progression from beginning to end. From the early and raw marriage of black metal and doom that set the foundation with genre classics Unlock the Shrine and Rain Upon the Impure , to the more melodic and ritualistic horrors of Foulest Semen of a Sheltered Elite and Blood Vaults , culminating in the ritual-imbued pinnacle Exuvia , the act has an uncanny ability to recall the familiar while trudging into unexplored territory.\u201d Ruins, runes, and revulsion. Bite Down \u2013 Violent Playground Review By Samguineous Maximus on January 13, 2026 in Reviews , Deathcore , Metalcore , Nu Metal , 66 comments \u201c\u00e2\u0080\u009cTikTok deathcore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two words guaranteed to make trve metalheads shudder inside their J\u00c3\u00b8rn-adorned battle jackets. It\u2019s also a term that could apply to a vast swathe of newer deathcore acts; each chasing the viral glory of Will Ramos reaction videos through near-endless vertical content. Enter Sweden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bite Down , who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ridden this wave to a respectable level of buzz across a steady drip-feed of singles and EPs, with their debut, Violent Playground .\u201d Toothsome or untoother? UUHAI \u2013 Human Herds Review By Lavender Larcenist on January 12, 2026 in Reviews , Hard Rock , 38 comments \u201cIt is well-established at this point that Mongolia is metal as fuck. Who would have thought that a landlocked country with a population of approximately 3.5 million people would have such a significant impact on culture? From the legends surrounding Genghis Khan to the fact that major IPs like Dune and Predator are incorporating throat singing to enrich their soundscapes, Mongolia has had a lasting impact that far surpasses its relatively small footprint. While Mongolian metal isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t storming the charts consistently, bands like The Hu have seen massive breakthrough success, with hits listened to by a fanbase that dwarfs the population of their native country. Jumping in on the train is a new band from those storied steppes, UUHAI .\u201d Why no Fleshgod uuhai. Oraculum \u2013 Hybris Divina Review By Owlswald on January 12, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 23 comments \u201cNew year, new beginnings. And just as my resolutions refresh and my word count resets to zero, Chilean quartet Oraculum arrives to break the seal. These connoisseurs of the \u201ctried and true\u201d first graced these pages more than ten years ago with their counter-breaking EP, Sorcery of the Damned \u00e2\u0080\u0094back when EPs still qualified for regular reviews outside of our now annual EP/Split/Single Roundups. That initial offering was a grim manifesto on old-school death metal (OSDM), forging deathly Incantation s into a sharp, lethal slab of barbaric hostility.\u201d Olde but still bolde?

AOA / Oi Polloi Unlimited Genocide split LP reissue Fuck me, although I feel like we\u2019re barely in autumn, it is actually past Christmastime already, and for the consumerist nightmare it always entails, Santa might have been in a punk rock phase last year, because I got assigned a genuine UK anarcho-punk classic for review: the Unlimited Genocide split LP between AOA and OI POLLOI from Scotland. Originally released in 1986 on Children of the Revolution, it has remained a largely unsung classic and has finally gotten the proper reissue treatment thanks to Sealed Records, which we all should be thankful for. Although not the biggest name in the hardest-hitting anarcho-punk school of the \u201980s (being Scottish may sadly not have helped in a very London-centric scene), AOA recorded three crucial\u2014and hard-to-find, obviously\u2014records during their run, and this is the second one. Being a sucker for the genre, I have been a massive fan since I first heard them through a wise punk elder. AOA has often been described as furious, and the attribute is well-deserved. Fast-paced, angry, DISCHARGE-inspired political hardcore punk, just before the rise of UK crust and the metal invasion. I am heavily reminded of cult bands like ANTISECT or ANTI-SYSTEM, but I\u2019d argue that the Scots may have given more than a passing listen to the ICONOCLAST as well. On the other side, we have the much more famous and iconic anarcho band OI POLLOI, who everyone knows at least by name and is able to sing along to \u201cPunx Picnic.\u201d I guess you could say that, despite a certain status and popularity, we don\u2019t really explore the band\u2019s long discography critically, and their side of the split documents them at a time when they still partook in anthemic, if a bit cheesy, rough anarcho Oi! (like on the split with BETRAYED), but also embracing the faster and more abrasive anarcho-punk philosophy in terms of sound (like on the TOXIK EPHEX one)\u2014like any sane punk would have done, really. What\u2019s great with OI POLLOI is that you can instantly recognize Deek\u2019s very distinctive vocals, so you always know where you stand. The songs here are mostly fast, but the band also slows things down, remaining heavy and threatening. I forgot how great these songs were, very reminiscent of ICONS OF FILTH, CONFLICT, or even ANTISECT, and it\u2019s got my favourite of theirs, \u201cThe Only Release.\u201d A great record that tackled political issues that are sadly as relevant as ever today. Essential stuff. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Sealed Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Cemento Bad Dream Songs LP CEMENTO out of Los Angeles has been compiling a library of goth-inspired post-punk epics for the past few years, and many of those tracks appear on their fresh full-length entitled Bad Dream Songs . Produced in conjunction with Iron Lung Records, CEMENTO\u2019s sound is pushed to a monolithic depth on Bad Dream Songs , allowing the band to fully exhibit their artistry. If you were into Sacred Bones\u2019 release of the HUNT\u2019s The Hunt Begins in 2013, or if you\u2019re into things like the early works of the CULT and CHRISTIAN DEATH, then you should check out Bad Dream Songs . Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 DSM-5 / Varoitus \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland Jawbreaker split LP A crushing split LP pairing two distinct but equally bleak visions of modern hardcore. DSM-5 delivers suffocating, noise-laced hardcore punk that feels mentally claustrophobic, with repetitive riffs and desperate vocals mirroring psychological collapse. VAROITUS counters with cold Finnish D-beat, sharp and militant, channeling classic Scandinavian hardcore with a contemporary sense of urgency. A relentless record that leaves no room for comfort. Un split LP demoledor que une dos visiones distintas pero igualmente sombr\u00edas del hardcore actual. DSM-5 presenta un hardcore punk asfixiante y cargado de ruido, con riffs repetitivos y voces desesperadas que reflejan un colapso mental constante. VAROITUS responde con D-beat finland\u00e9s fr\u00edo y militante, afilado y urgente, heredero directo del hardcore escandinavo cl\u00e1sico. Un disco implacable, sin concesiones. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Phobia Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Emmett O.C. 9 From the Warped Mind LP First solo project from Emmett O\u2019Connor (ARCHIE AND THE BUNKERS, MK ULTRAS) out of Cleveland. Inside this warped mind, we find bedroom synth punk complete with drum machine, warbling lead lines, and earnest, droning vocals, like on \u201cPieces of My Life\u201d where O\u2019Connor croons \u201cLike a shining light from up above / She came down and she gave me her love.\u201d \u201cBurger King From My Dreams\u201d gets a little sillier, and brings to mind the Technics organ tone of WESLEY WILLIS, with shades of \u201cRock n Roll McDonalds\u201d to boot. On \u201cThe Air Conditioning is Making Me Sick\u201d he gets a little heavier, channeling some BABY TYLER or maybe ALIEN NOSEJOB with a mock seriousness. \u201cCurtain Call\u201d plays that wobbly organ again, with some doo wop in place of the drum machine, which maybe leads us to his \u201950s rocker/James Dean influence displayed on the album cover? Layer all these things together, and I find myself thrown for a complete loop. Yet here I am, enjoying 9 From the Warped Mind quite a darn bit. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Sweet Time Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Fin Dystopia cassette Six-song debut cassette from Middle Tennessee. At first I thought FIN sounded like an alt-rock-leaning indie band, but after further observation, I now believe they sound like an indie-leaning alt-rock band. Might sound like a nominal distinction, but I stand by it, with the difference-maker being production quality. This debut cassette is self-recorded by the band and has a bit of grit to it. The obvious cue to me came with the last song, \u201cTalk Too Much,\u201d a repetitive grunge number which truly sounded to me like it could have been a reworked NIRVANA song. Any way you cut it, FIN seems to dabble in a lot of \u201990s throwback genres, so if the \u201990s are your thing, snag yourself one of the 25 copies of this tape before you miss out. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label Tennessee Cold Cuts Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Gape Reduced to Nothing EP Minimal and direct. Los Angeles-based GAPE opens with a blast of do-or-die hardcore energy. Eight tracks, just over ten minutes in total, and absolutely no filler. From the opening notes of \u201cWest Co.\u201d to the closing \u201cSeasons,\u201d the band delivers the kind of short, sharp, unforgiving intensity that hardcore was built for: fast tempos, fast riffs, and riot-inducing shouting. The record never lets up, exactly what you want from a 7\u2033 when you feel like you need to rip the world a new one. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Leti Y Los Utensilios Fuego EP Debut EP from LETI Y LOS UTENSILIOS from Madrid, Spain. Four songs of dark, brooding punk with driving bass that grounds a razorblade guitar, cymbal-crashing drums, and a female vocalist with plenty of bite. \u201cFuego\u201d and \u201cSubir Bajar\u201d on the A-side hit pretty hard and chug right along, while the B-side\u2019s \u201cHaloperidol\u201d and \u201cBotox\u201d fall into a bit more of a garage groove, with some guitar solos and riffing. Overall, this is a great debut, and I\u2019ll be excited to see where they go from here. Reviewer Willis Schenk Label Delia Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Night Court Nervous Birds! LP Vancouver\u2019s NIGHT COURT is back with a remastered reissue of their first two releases, ( Nervous Birds! One and Nervous Birds! Too ) on one LP. NIGHT COURT plays lo-fi garage pop that leans more toward the dirt pop spectrum than garage punk. It\u2019s straightforward, sometimes jangly, and there\u2019s a pop element throughout. The lyrics are audible and intelligent, full of pop culture references, wasted nights, and sarcasm, and often delivered via dual vocalists. \u201cSurfin Iona\u201d is a standout for me, with drummer Emilor taking the lead and sounding like a bizarro version of Kate Pierson of the B-52\u2019S. There\u2019s a line from the song \u201cYr Ride\u201d that stuck with me after a few listens: \u201cDeath is a hard ride / Heaven\u2019s a joyride / Until you get caught with your pants down.\u201d If there\u2019s a heaven, I certainly want to arrive bare-assed! For someone with zero attention span, 26 songs is a lot to digest at once. I get why these were originally separate releases, but existing fans will love having these in all one place and on vinyl for the first time. It\u2019s a cool showcase of the band\u2019s early output, and fans of bands like MARKED MEN or even early SHINS will find something to love. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Debt Offensive / Drunk Dial / Shield / Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Pill Mill Trimming the Fat EP British Columbia\u2019s PILL MILL deliver the goods on their debut EP, a speedy hardcore punk attack bursting at the seams with the same frantic energy that the X-Claim! roster excelled at. Turbo-charged riffs, manically paced drum fills, and distorted, sneering vocals ensure every box is checked, putting this in league with Neon Taste labelmates CHAIN WHIP and SSIK (with whom the band shares members). Highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Neon Taste Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Screensaver Three Lens Approach LP SCREENSAVER out of Melbourne has been pumping out material for the past six years, and on their latest full-length Three Lens Approach , they invite us to a gothic synth punk dub party that has us dancing to the unexpected shifts between DEVO-ish rhythms to more melancholic \u201cDeath Disco\u201d inspirations. Multiple synthesizers fire off as hard-hitting bass lines and fierce guitar licks create an immersive atmosphere, while Krystal Maynard\u2019s vocals are charged and velvety. Occasionally I\u2019m reminded of things like the EPOXIES or CRASH COURSE IN SCIENCE, but SCREENSAVER is definitely carving out a sound that is uniquely their own. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Poison City Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Serial Pest Living in Fear cassette Pure knuckle-dragging Aussie hardcore, with zero mercy. Living In Fear rips with frantic drums, guitar tone straight out of a damp squat, and vocals that sound like someone screaming through a wall of cigarette smoke. Everything here is fast, mean, and gloriously ugly. SERIAL PEST doesn\u2019t bother with anything resembling restraint, just wild, swinging chaos and fist-in-the-air rage. Feels less like a recording and more like stumbling into the wrong backyard show and getting shoved straight into the pit. If you want thrashy hardcore that bites, spits, and leaves the room smelling worse than when it started, this is it. Reviewer Jo\u00e3o Seixas Label Noise Merchant Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Shop Talk Museum of Sex / Gaslight 7\u2033 Solid two-song slab from this Brooklyn trio. Power pop with a little bit of a street punk edge, kind of like a beefier EXPLODING HEARTS/BUZZCOCKS concoction. Laden with earworm vocals and catchy guitar work, this pair of tracks goes by way too quickly. I want more, dammit! Really lovely work here. Add this to your winter playlist to combat your S.A.D. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label One Track Mind Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Sikphuxz Punk is Shit EP Formed in Victoria, BC in 1979, SIKPHUXZ was the first effort from Murray \u201cThe Cretin\u201d Acton, who would later go on to assemble the legendary DAYGLO ABORTIONS. Though there were no official releases from these early Canadian punks, they did record a handful of tracks that have been unearthed and remastered on this archival EP that comes with extensive liner notes and photos. The roots of Murray\u2019s trademark irreverence are on display here in songs like the title track and \u201cI\u2019m So Dumb,\u201d alongside more straightforward punk tunes like \u201cLet\u2019s Run Away\u201d and \u201cP.O.W.,\u201d offering an interesting glimpse of history. It\u2019s a cool little package, and the DAYGLO guys are still going strong today, with members having been arrested on drug charges as recently as fall of last year. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Supreme Echo Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Abism Barbie Terminator EP Right before the first time I heard ABISM\u2019s new 7\u201d, I\u2019d just finished jamming a live boot of the VELVET UNDERGROUND, and I was amazed by the freedom of the faded guitar pokes and messing around, demonstrating how bravely primitive and self-conscious they were (and which I guess is the essence of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, to be a confident dilettante). This feeling probably stuck with me when \u201cBarbie Terminator\u201d kicked in with its cacophonic guitar scraping and burst of pumping beats that meticulously, or by instinct, are set to a tempo that grabs attention and moves bodies. Then by the second song, the fuzzed guitars started playing notes that are weird, not too technically difficult but remarkable when paired with confidence and taste, because fuck it\u2014some of us do mess around with such ideas at odd hours of the day under odd circumstances and wonder whether it is okay to include them even in radikal punk songs. ABISM\u2019s new record is a straight \u201cfuck you\u201d to those thoughts, because this sounds great and it fits a hardcore song. Only four rudimental hardcore tracks reflecting the universal frame of many signature scenes\u2019 sound, with a wink to those roots that make the record sound simple and original, and which combined recall dozens of the best bands without referencing any of them. This balance is the challenge of sounding original nowadays after everybody has heard everything and still ever-wanting more of this raw power. Another highly confident \u201cfuck you\u201d is the riff of \u201cFly Away\u201d\u2026you have a four-song 7\u201d, and you dedicate a significant amount of time to summon LENNY KRAVITZ in the subconscious of your listeners? That is bold. But even the realization of this bizarre thing is not able to keep me from loving this record. I love the non-stop pogo beat and tight groove that delivers all the weird and cool guitar sounds, and the best raspy voice (familiar from the amazing GARRAPATA). Reviewer Viktor Vargyai Label Toxic State Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Atol Atol Atol Dron Dron Dron LP ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s 2023 LP Koniec Sosu Tysi\u0105ca Wysp completely threw me for a loop\u2014taut, twin-vocal Polish art-punk with a minor DOG FACED HERMANS fixation? I might as well be Pavlov\u2019s dog. Follow-up Dron Dron Dron is just as mind-warping, centering the band\u2019s anxious electronic textures and snap-tight rhythms like an alternate-timeline Hardcore -era DEVO that wound up on Ron Johnson Records alongside the EX and BIG FLAME. Opener \u201cNeon\u201d is a perfect example of the band\u2019s controlled chaos, locking straight into a staccato, mechanical groove with skittering guitar, a bass line bouncing everywhere like an errant rubber Superball, and doubled-up chants from vocalists \u0141ukasz and Agata, all of which could be panic-inducing (or just irritating) in lesser hands, but it\u2019s completely hypnotic here. Likewise, the densely knotted skronk of \u201cBlok\u201d might easily tip into prog-punk territory were it not for some wild, collapsing drum breakdowns, but when the frenetic call-and-response in \u201cP\u0142ytki Sen\u201d hits against some incessantly buzzing synth and treble-maxed guitar cutting in like the quickest of knife flicks, there\u2019s no question that ATOL ATOL ATOL\u2019s true objective is putting the damage back in \u201cart-damaged,\u201d and they\u2019re killing it. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Mangel / Red Wig Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Blood Cannery Olympic Blood cassette If you\u2019re in the mood for something challenging, BLOOD CANNERY\u2019s latest concept album about a man facing (possibly supernatural) beasts on the early American frontier might be exactly what you\u2019re searching for. \u201cOlympic Blood\u201d sounds like a LIGHTNING BOLT-versus-KYUSS showdown with super-fuzzed, whammy-heavy guitar shreds placed against hyperactive drums and muffled vocals. The lyrical tales of curses, attacking brutes, and violence sometimes evokes aesthetically coherent heavy punk experimentation, and sometimes skews toward \u201c Faaaar out, man!\u201d stoner excess, but it\u2019s always enjoyable. Check it out for a conceptual romp through blood, dirt, and heavy riffs. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Knuckles on Stun Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Cheap Fix Re-Animator Blues / French Song 7\u2033 This is CHEAP FIX\u2019s debut 7\u201d. Garage punkers from your dad\u2019s days. They all play in a bunch of different bands (TRAINWRECK, ENDURO, DECEMBER BOYS) and join together on this 7\u201d for two songs sans bass guitar. This is workin\u2019 class, \u201cdone with the day job,\u201d fuzzy, bluesy shit from the constant maestros in class, Goodbye Boozy. Could be Mark Arm\u2019s cousin singing. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Goodbye Boozy Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Contrast Attitude Discharge Your Noise LP Although they have been around for more than 25 years, Discharge Your Noise is only CONTRAST ATTITUDE\u2019s second album. Needless to say, I preordered what promised to be an exercise in intensity and ferocity as soon as possible\u2014the limited version of course, out of excitement. It would be far-fetched to claim that these Mie punks have drastically changed their sound (a new drummer, Daigo from DECEIVING SOCIETY or RADIOACTIVE, did join them, though), but I have to confess that I was a little disappointed when I first played the vinyl. Of course, the high-level energy and relentless hardcore aggression, trademarks of the band\u2019s sound, are still there, but the guitar is not as distorted, if perhaps heavier, and I suppose on this LP, CONTRAST ATTITUDE cannot really be described as the crust monster they once were. As a result, probably because I was expecting that typical \u201cwall of noise\u201d bollocking like it was still 2009, I was, well, disenchanted for a bit. Listening to the LP again for this review, I realize that it is, in fact, a solid work that, once I accepted change, I was more than able to enjoy thoroughly and play air guitar to when no one is looking. The music is still as fast and punishing, the vocals as anguished and extreme, the unstoppable D-beat noize has not disappeared, but a lot of the arrangements (and generally the songwriting and the production) point to more traditional Japanese hardcore to my ears. The band even experiments with paces a little with the very punky \u201cFeeling of the Freedom\u201d and the heavier and slower \u201cDisclose Naked Myself.\u201d I feel Discharge Your Noise is in between both styles, and while it won\u2019t alienate the traditional CONTRAST ATTITUDE fans, it may actually appeal to other people who don\u2019t necessarily wear DISCLOSE pajamas (unlike me). A good record that I still wish was a little crustier. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Desolate / D-Takt & R\u00e5punk Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Dark Thoughts Highway to the End LP Six years after their last record, Philadelphia\u2019s DARK THOUGHTS have reemerged as dialed-in as ever on this brand new slab. The tunes are tight and concise, never overstaying their welcome and always getting the point across within their brief duration. Applying the poppy and speedy formula of classic SCREECHING WEASEL and RAMONES to maximum effect, the songs hit hard with relatability, realism, and hope. They\u2019re what I wished every band sounded like when I was sixteen. \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Be Lonesome\u201d is the perfect reassuring follow-up to the previous album\u2019s heartbreaking \u201cWith You,\u201d with which I positively tortured myself at the time of its release. Or is \u201cSweet Success\u201d the real happy ending? Either way, I\u2019m glad the story isn\u2019t over. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Drunken Sailor / Stupid Bag Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Flux Peace is a Lie LP Ten pogo-inducing corkers from Belgium\u2019s latest and greatest FLUX, a band that has done their homework and sounds as authentic as anything from the UK in 1982. Speed, anger, and just the right amount of snot make this a thoroughly enjoyable listen; by the halfway point of \u201cPunk Retaliation,\u201d you\u2019ll be pumping your fist and spilling your beer along to the proceedings. For fans of SAVAGEHEADS, VAXINE, and the MASSACRED. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Havana Syndrome Kill Your Brain cassette Demented synth punkers HAVANA SYNDROME are back with a quickness after dropping a demo tape in July. Look at the cover art: a brain mainlined into a computer monitor displaying a punk whose face is being eaten by his own brain! Cool. This should give you an idea of what you\u2019re in for. It\u2019s aggressive, it\u2019s fast, and the synths give the songs life through a vein of electro insanity. On songs like \u201cWrapped Boots\u201d and \u201cMind Control,\u201d the vocalist yelps and hollers like a wounded animal around pulsing guitar and synth lines. It would be easy to compare them to bands like RESEARCH REACTOR CORPORATION, but it kicks way more ass. Think LUMPY & THE DUMPERS imprinting onto members of the LOCUST. Pick this up and kill your brain. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Swimming Faith Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Lamictal Lamictal cassette OC punk slop from the future. This is a solo project from Alex Colettogents, who is associated with seizure-core spazzers GNARLES MANSON and X-ACTO. Coming out of this eight-song tape, there is some vertigo and nausea that will take a moment to wear off. Once it does, I can say that there is slight intrigue, egg-punk on 78, dysphonia, a cacophony of eight tracks all barely clocking in at six retching minutes. Is he alone in this chaos? In the end, \u201cCan\u2019t Stand My Dreams\u201d is worthy of note. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Pop Affliction Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Melkus Discografia Due LP Leipzig\u2019s MELKUS has a distinct sound of their own that really enchanted me. Fast and furious sequences that smoothly transition into melodic passages, dark and mysterious garage sounds that get better and better with each layer, and catchy hooks peeking around every corner\u2026it\u2019s one of those albums where every part flows perfectly into the next. While guitar and bass with gloriously filthy tones lock into each other to form amazing riffs, punchy drums not only accompany them but also add another layer of that explosive energy. Charismatic vocals are definitely the cherry on top of this beautiful rock\u2019n\u2019roll cake, along with the momentary bursts of ear-candy from miscellaneous instruments like saxophone, organ, and synths. The dark and gritty production style of this LP complements the band\u2019s sound flawlessly, too. I really like this one, and I\u2019m already looking forward to their next release. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label It's Eleven Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 No Idols The Fall EP Excellent hardcore punk from Baltimore\u2019s NO IDOLS, a band composed of members of ANGEL DU$T, BIB and TRUTH CULT. Muscular and tough as hell, NO IDOLS draw from Feel the Darkness -era POISON IDEA, with catchy leads and heavy riffs galore. You can hear the pedigree behind these songs; they feel a little more complete and pulled together than your usual hardcore fare. One of 2025\u2019s best 7\u201ds. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Iron Lung Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Plastika Sijamski Blizanac LP PLASTIKA is from Croatia and plays raw, hardcore punk, and Sijamski Blizanac is their ten-track full-length that delivers a noisy pummeling. Think KRIMEWATCH but faster, and oh yeah, the lyrics aren\u2019t in English, but not knowing the words in their native language really doesn\u2019t matter with how tight tracks like \u201cNervoza\u201d and \u201cKaj Sad\u201d are. PLASTIKA has a rare authenticity in their energy which makes their delivery of primitive hardcore that much more enjoyable of a listening experience. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Onesna\u017eevanje Uma Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Saints of Lorain Before We Were Saints cassette Gonna do my best to break this somewhat confusing one down and hope that I\u2019ve got my facts straight. SAINTS OF LORAIN are from Cleveland, OH and put out a digital demo in 2023. This is the second release by the band, a \u201ccollection\u201d of songs which were written by the members\u2019 former band AL & THE COHOLICS (the collection featuring a grand total of six songs). AL & THE COHOLICS formed in 1999, and when the drummer died in 2014, his brother apparently promised to keep the music alive. Fast forward to the present and the brother is the drummer of this band, and the songs that would have been lost to time are now documented. What an absolutely lovely sentiment. Never would I ever have thought that the actions of members of a long-running drunk punk/street punk/pirate-punk band would hit on sentimentality as strong as this. Musically, this is complicated, uptempo slap bass street punk. If you like songs about being drunk, being addicted to drugs, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, or sex, or you were around for the heyday of AL & THE COHOLICS, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna have a great time with this tape. Reviewer Biff Bifaro Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Small Doses Rodeo EP Pretty nifty record here with plenty of nuances, combining pieces of orgcore (melodic vocals paired with power-chord-driven punk songs \u00e0 la BAD RELIGION and LAGWAGON) with post-hardcore (dissonant chords, slower tempos, and throaty screams that reminds me a lot of POLAR BEAR CLUB if they had embraced more of the Dischord style). I guess you can call this post-orgcore (although I\u2019m not even sure if that term is in vogue anymore). Well-crafted tracks that do a great job telling a narrative\u2014both musically and lyrically\u2014that never once gets boring. Great work here. As far as punk goes, this is as perfect of an EP as you\u2019ll get. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Sn\u00f6rkler Hot Dignity Dog and Other Future Classics cassette Spastic egg-punk is what y\u2019all might call SN\u00d6LKER nowadays, but it was called Very Small Records-esqe back before that term was around. It has all the perfect elements of FALSE SACRAMENT, SCHLONG, NONMEANSNO, or VICTIMS FAMILY, with keyboards for all the sulphur egginess you can handle. Four tunes that clock in under nine minutes, all plopped onto a cassette tape. The coughing on the tune \u201cVape Man\u201d is perfect. Also, I think I\u2019m hearing a flute layered in here. What the fuck is this gorgeous tidal wave of gross perfection called, you ask? I guess it\u2019s called SN\u00d6RKLER. Reviewer Tony Party Label What's For Breakfast? Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 TV Casualties Orphanage Fire CD Self-proclaimed \u201cCanola Hardcore,\u201d whatever the hell that means. This sounds like a band that you saw on the Warped Tour when you were thirteen years old whose name you can\u2019t remember. The EP is self-produced and self-released which is commendable, but the songs are generic and unmemorable. You could put it on in the background and no one will be offended, but no one\u2019s going to ask you who it is, either. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label self-released Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 Zlodzieje Rowerow Ka\u017cdy Inny Wszyscy R\u00f3wni EP Melodic yet confrontational punk rock from Poland, rooted in DIY ethics and social awareness. ZLODZIEJE ROWEROW delivers mid-tempo anthems with heartfelt vocals and strong choruses, balancing aggression and melody with ease. The lyrics emphasize equality and solidarity, making this EP both politically charged and emotionally resonant. Punk rock mel\u00f3dico y combativo desde Polonia, con una fuerte base DIY y conciencia social. ZLODZIEJE ROWEROW presentan himnos de medio tiempo con coros s\u00f3lidos y voces cargadas de emoci\u00f3n, equilibrando agresi\u00f3n y melod\u00eda con naturalidad. Las letras giran en torno a la igualdad y la solidaridad, logrando un EP tan pol\u00edtico como emotivo. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Refuse Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 V/A Right on Time Re:imagined LP I try to refrain from using the phrase \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d when writing about music (in real life, I may not apologize enough). But in this case, I can\u2019t conceive of any other way to rationalize how I feel about what I\u2019m duty-bound to say. Right on Time Re:imagined is easily the worst release I\u2019ve had to suffer through listening to in a long, long time. Each and every song is bad, some extraordinarily so. What we have here are six versions of the same song, interpreted by different artists in distinct genres spanning the gamut from \u201cSexy Stoner Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll\u201d to \u201cEmo Pop Punk\u201d and \u201cHeavenly Metal.\u201d There\u2019s even an \u201cUnplugged Hardcore\u201d rendition that is more egregious than whatever you\u2019re imagining. The song that is the basis for such wide and varied explication is a by-the-numbers youth crew ditty called \u201cRight on Time.\u201d As a stand-alone track, it\u2019s a decent slice of impassioned straightedge hardcore, with a message that offers genuine positivity in the face of adversity. And herein lies the source of my initial plea for forgiveness\u2026this whole project is inspired by a member of the band RIGHT ON TIME\u2019s battle against cancer, and is an ode to the support they received from friends in the darkest moments of that experience. Profits from this release support a Dutch foundation, No Guts No Glory, that is dedicated to making the music-related wishes of cancer patients come true. Truly a fantastic cause, and one that I do not wish to denigrate just because I don\u2019t like the music involved. If you dig sXe hardcore and have broad enough interests, this may be right up your alley. In any case, there\u2019s a worthy cause attached to this that makes my snarky take on the tunes irrelevant. Fuck cancer! Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Positive and Focused Issue MRR #512 \u2022 January 2026 100 Flowers Presence of Mind EP reissue Shortly after the URINALS changed their name to 100 FLOWERS, they cemented the switch with the release of this artsy 7\u201d in 1982. A bit more explorational than their earlier output, which brought us dum-dum classics like \u201cI\u2019m A Bug\u201d and \u201cAck Ack Ack Ack,\u201d the band\u2019s evolved style on this three-song EP is more in line with the sound of early WIRE and PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED. The dark disco of the title track leads the proceedings, an energetic post-punk number that would eventually make its way onto the group\u2019s LP the following year. Next up, the brief and bouncy \u201cDyslexia\u201d quickly reminds us that we\u2019re still dealing with the same guys that wrote \u201cI Am White and Middle Class.\u201d On the flipside, \u201cMop Dub\u201d is an instrumental backwards treatment of \u201cPresence of Mind,\u201d providing a symmetrical bookend that suits the fashion of the era. Faithfully reissued in its original format, this poignant little slab documents the iconic unit\u2019s transition from weird to weirder. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Spacecase Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Axe Il Cimitero \u00e8 Dappertutto cassette Italy\u2019s Sistema Mortal has had an excellent year, starting off with the head-splitting FARCE 7\u201d and wrapping things up with this killer debut from Milan\u2019s AXE. Featuring two vocalists and a raw, crusty sound, AXE plays with a little more texture and melody (and I think keyboard) than your usual D-beat fare. Opening track \u201cPatto di Sangue\u201d kicks off with an ominously dark tone that quickly morphs into full on m\u00e4ngel fury that doesn\u2019t let up for the entirety of the tape. A total scorcher and highly recommended. Reviewer Eric Anderson Label Sistema Mortal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Billiam The Letter W & the Numeral B EP Melbourne\u2019s BILLIAM is back with another EP, his fourth release this year. There\u2019s nothing new here, and any of the four tracks could have appeared on any of the project\u2019s previous efforts. If you\u2019ve enjoyed any of his other records, you\u2019ll dig this. \u201cNew Wave\u201d and \u201cHouston We Have Rock\u201d are full of fuzzy three-chord punk, battered with synthesizers and left scrambling to catch up to the lo-fi hi-hats working overtime in the background. The vocals sound like they were recorded through a cell phone inside of a cave, which kind of ruins it for me, although repeating the phrase \u201cHouston, we have rock\u201d 16 times in 54 seconds brought a smile to my face. The B-side is more mid-tempo and features the highlight of the EP for me, the closing \u201cEssential Feedstock Oils,\u201d where they repeat the word \u201crecord\u201d 27 times in 90 seconds. Heavy SPARKS vibes with a bedroom charm. It ain\u2019t for me, but fans of 1-800-MIKEY and GEE TEE will eat it up. Reviewer Sir Bobos Label Low Ambition Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 C.A.M.O. Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry 12\u2033 If you played this for me and told me it came out in 1985, I\u2019d believe you, but C.A.M.O. out of Vienna, Austria exists in 2025, and thanks to Mendeku Diskak, their cassette Combative Anthems Motivate Outcry is now available as a vinyl disc. Anarcho-punk with a cold bent makes C.A.M.O. sound indignant and haunting, and this eight-song album is full of sonic macabre with ominous lyrics and guitar riffs that sound adjacent to funeral marches. If you dig early KILLING JOKE, 1919, or PART1, then go check out C.A.M.O. right now. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label Mendeku Diskak Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Condumb Disassociation EP Crasher-crust noise punk from Philadelphia. It\u2019s a well-crafted 7\u201d where both the songwriting and the smart usage of the classic pedal arsenal are strong\u2014there is a good balance between fast- and mid-tempos, and the screaming vocals let the songs breathe but sound forceful when they\u2019re happening. The songs are so well-written that they would work without the screaming/swirling jet sounds of the guitar, which in could go against the noise-not-music ethos within the record, as the added effects are not masking rather traditional songs but upgrading primitive, non-existent ideas to something truly otherworldly. Here, the noise is masking knowledge and talent if you let yourself lead into mindless headbanging (which the record offers), but if you arrive via the main bands of the members, you probably will not feel cheated, either. Or if you listen beyond aesthetics and pay attention to what is actually happening. Nowadays, the look and slogans of this style seem more popular than ever, yet most bands do not come close to getting the essence of this sound. CONDUMB does; they get it and do it just right. Reviewer Viktor Vargyai Label Stupid Bag Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dead Bug 6 or 12 New Songs cassette NYC/Richmond, CA duo DEAD BUG\u2019s 6 or 12 New Songs is not really an album, but more of an experiment on interpreting visual data and translating it into music. It goes like this: there is a zine called 5 New Songs which has cryptic drawings and enigmatic descriptions that symbolize abstract ideas for five different songs. Both members of the band work alone to write and record their respective sides with their interpretation of what those songs would sound like. The results are really interesting and it\u2019s definitely a thought-provoking experiment. But I think reviewing and trying to describe how it sounds would defeat its purpose, as it requires listeners to connect the dots between the music and the visuals. I highly recommend checking it out and maybe even trying it yourself. Reviewer Mama Goblin Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Embittered This Failed Endeavor cassette Raw, pissed-off hardcore punk with a distinctly bleak tone. EMBITTERED tears through short, furious tracks driven by urgent drumming and a bitter vocal delivery. The cassette format suits the band perfectly\u2014lo-fi but powerful, emphasizing frustration, alienation, and total rejection of false optimism. Hardcore meant to be felt, not polished. Hardcore punk crudo y cargado de bronca, con un tono marcadamente sombr\u00edo. Embittered avanzan a trav\u00e9s de canciones cortas y furiosas, impulsadas por una bater\u00eda urgente y voces cargadas de resentimiento. El formato cassette le sienta perfecto al material: sonido \u00e1spero, directo, enfocado en la frustraci\u00f3n y el rechazo absoluto al optimismo vac\u00edo. Reviewer Gonza Perez Label Hey Fuck You Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Fungas Intelligence 1 LP Sci-fi egg-punk from Australia that mixes DEVO-core vocals and herky-jerky rhythms with maximum dork power (they\u2019re really into rocks, apparently?). Sneaky spy riffs tangle with alien synths for a familiar but fun high-energy blast. \u201ci1\u201d pulls back the shtick just a bit to allow classic new wave melodies to emerge and build a near-perfect multi-layered pop song. If you like this kind of stuff, you\u2019ll like this record\u2014it\u2019s well-produced and carefully composed for maximum party impact. Reviewer Nick Odorizzi Label Erste Theke Tontr\u00e4ger Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Holly and the Nice Lions Dolores LP I went to Green Bay UFO Museum Gift Shop and Records for the first time a few years ago when I decided to drive the northern route around Lake Michigan to Minneapolis. I walked out of there with some great records on Amphetamine Reptile and a Darth Vader bank for my cousin that would activate with every road bump and say \u201cImpressive, most impressive, you are not a Jedi yet.\u201d There were a lot of bumps. Still, with that slap-tickle memory, I was excited to see that they had something to do with this release. I researched (typed into an Internet browser) Certified PR Records and found that they are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, where long-ago Maximum Rocknroll shitworker, reviewer, columnist, and interviewer Lali D lives, so it can\u2019t be that bad. I heard that St. Pete has a good glass arts scene, too. This Dolores LP starts off with a song clocking in at over four minutes, pulling from the dark side of the dirge-like, cloud-covered Midwest, but around the two-minute mark, it becomes a straight-up middle-finger rocker. This easily could have been on Sympathy for the Record Industry with its lean into the punk side of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. The standout on this is the HOLLY part of HOLLY AND THE NICE LIONS band, and her direct and committed vocals. Oftentimes I\u2019ve felt that singers can tend to overdo it with screaming to try and get across their disgust or pain or anger, but in this instance, HOLLY uses good songwriting coupled with subtle vocal tones and inflection to let you know she\u2019s had enough. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t touch on Steven Spoerl\u2019s bass-playing that complements every song, almost as though another dim and somber conversation is taking place somewhere in the same room, with Travis Pashek\u2019s drums pulling you forward through a late-night drive north, hugging the lake shore alone with everything getting darker and darker. This record, in sum, is thoughtful, heavy, dark, empowering, sorrowful, and redeeming rock\u2019n\u2019roll/punk/sludge/garage. Dolores is for those times that you want to be alone to work out what\u2019s been bugging you. HOLLY AND THE NICE LIONS have been a band for over a decade, and I\u2019m a bit sad that I\u2019m just hearing them now. In closing, my cousin loved his Darth Vader bank, and think he\u2019s going to love this record, too. He\u2019s 53. Reviewer Tony Party Label Certified PR / Green Bay UFO Museum Gift Shop and Records Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Industry Industry LP Berlin-based INDUSTRY has been gathering steam from the past two years and has finally unleashed their self-titled full-length. Burly punk rock with jazz compositions and an aggro vibe creates a ten-song LP that reads as monolithic but is overtly so much more. In other words, lyrics born out of exasperation are delivered over rumbling rhythms and grinding guitars that shift grooves frequently, but always seem to get your head banging. If you\u2019ve had your fill of AXEGRINDER and are looking for something more, then look no further than INDUSTRY. Reviewer Seth McBurney Label La Vida Es Un Mus Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Lake Inferior Five Ahead / Avoid All Robots 7\u2033 Wow, this is a phenomenal pair of songs here. Sinister doom-goth-surf rock, as if WEEDEATER decided they wanted to sound more like the CRAMPS and Danzig-era MISFITS. I love the unintentional (at least I assume it\u2019s unintentional) irony of their song \u201cFive Ahead,\u201d which features the lyrics \u201cFive years ahead of our time / Ten years behind.\u201d This certainly sounds like it\u2019s from the future and not at all dated or \u201cbehind.\u201d The B-side (\u201cAvoid All Robots\u201d) is equal parts retro-futuristic and a cautionary tale for our current AI-addled society. Really great slab here. Highly recommended. Reviewer Jake Joyce Label self-released Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Model Martel A Thousand Couple Times LP MODEL MARTEL has a parallel sound with many bands on Tiny Engines Records and the Lauren Records style of Midwest-centric emo-punk-pop-core. This is shitty jobs, friends you can\u2019t depend on, broken relationships, expecting more from life, and finding comfort in late night talks, all wrapped in guitar hooks and melancholic melody. If I were 25 years younger, I would be calling this my favorite record of 2025 because of how it encapsulates life\u2019s twenties and thirties. A solid, lyrically-focused rite of passage LP, open-eyed on broken and healing, punctuated with tight bass and drums. There are only 300 of these LPs, on all of the different colors that an LP could be, perhaps. A Thousand Couple Times , although budding with infectious hooks, has a regretful and foreboding lyrical sorrow to it that always seems to be amplified by a band\u2019s proximity to the Great Lakes. Reviewer Tony Party Label Snappy Little Numbers Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 The Not This Record Contains Not One Hit Single\u2026 + I Do Not Care!!! CD Off-kilter Japanese punkers NOT existed in the early 2000s, sticking around for just long enough to record the thirteen rough-hewn tracks showcased on this CD. Injecting straightforward \u201977 punk in the vein of the KNOCKS with a bit of modern meddle like the BLACK AND WHITE, the band\u2019s sound is ultimately a quirky take on \u201990s garage punk style. The opening groove to \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Back to Me\u201d is a straight-up REGISTRATORS swipe, and the winding instrumental \u201cMituwadai 101\u201d sounds like it could be a GASOLINE jam session captured in uncharacteristically clean fidelity. Tracks one through eight are from the band\u2019s most realized recording, titled This Record Contains Not One Hit Single , and the remaining songs are taken from their 2004 demo ( I Do Not Care ), bringing you the full NOT experience on one disc. A brief interview with the group\u2019s founder Hidde included in this package alludes to a reunion gig slated for 2026, so keep an eye out if you happen to find yourself in Chiba prefecture this coming year. Reviewer Jason Harding Label Private Scandal Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Dre Perish Twist of Fate LP New Orleans artist/producer DRE PERISH (also of the noise punk duo QUARTER RATS) is a self-styled \u201cpsych punk/no wave junkie,\u201d and their new LP seems to push that identity in every direction at once. PERISH handles vocals, guitar, bass, synths, sax, beats, and samples, with guest players dropping in on about half the tracks. Across its eleven songs and three field recordings, the album meanders between styles like a Tuesday-night CBGB audition lineup: opening with a NINE INCH NAILS-leaning opener, then a detour into alternative/art rock, the rumble of a passing train, and then \u201cAll Night!\u201d\u2014the standout for me, which sounds like it could\u2019ve come off one of the more chaotic OSEES recordings. There\u2019s also a crunchy/synthy cover of GANG OF FOUR\u2019s \u201cTo Hell With Poverty!\u201d I found myself gravitating toward the tracks played with real instruments and patiently waiting for the synth-heavy ones to end, but that\u2019s just personal taste. For most people, this will either be a challenging listen or a novelty, but if you\u2019ve got a wide-open brain and enjoy listening to an artist follow every weird instinct, Twist of Fate might be an entertaining journey. Reviewer Jeff Cost Label Primitive Postures / Strange Daisy Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Precipice Down the Well 12\u2033 PRECIPICE is a band that formed during COVID and put out a demo that I heard yet quickly lost interest in. Down the Well is a welcomed return, and is demonstrative of the Nantes group strengthening and turning the knobs. Bass-driven in an almost KILLDOZER-like way, the eight tracks are spread evenly with hate and indignation. A minute-long beatdown with \u201cA Customary Behavior in a Particular Situation\u201d is my mixtape track. Good bruisers. Reviewer Johnny Leach Label Discos Enfermos / Urticaria Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Royal Scum Human Gallantry EP This is a perfect example of a cover being a poor illustration of the music included on the record. In terms of semiotics, using a rather gruesome black-and-white picture of a horse being hung on a deck points to growling, nihilistic grindcore, but ROYAL SCUM from Hamburg does not belong to that school, rather playing heavy and dark crusty hardcore with some moody melodies. The band is actually more of a collective and does not have a fixed lineup, so I do not know if the members of this version of the band were around in the \u201900s, but I would bet they were because ROYAL SCUM has that typical quite well-produced neocrusty sound that was so popular back then. It would be far-fetched to claim that they stand as an all-out FROM ASHES RISE-type band, but early/mid-\u201900s ACURSED or UNKIND come to mind, although they do not sound quite as bleak, and the vocal delivery in English\u2014as well as the use of several angry singers\u2014makes me think of US bands (like ANTIPRODUCT, maybe?). With ROYAL SCUM being pro-vegan, I assume the cover is meant to reflect human cruelty toward animals, and I would guess the band is not too keen on the monarchy (even if Germany, besides Franz Beckenbauer, has not had a king for a while). On the whole, Human Gallantry is a pretty solid listen if you enjoy this sort of politically-driven, heavy, angry hardcore with dark melodies, and the EP works well and does perfectly what it set out to do. Reviewer Romain Basset Label Aktiver Ausstand In Plastik / Bolzkow / Frontcore / Zann's Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Slang Rest in Misery LP Sapporo City legends return after a decade of silence with all the subtlety of a bomb blast. Stoke-on-Trent meets NYHC in a glorious amalgamation that still sounds fresh and innovative over thirty years on. The vitality and rage hasn\u2019t faded in the least, and one gets the sense that SLANG has reemerged in response to the deteriorating global political climate. In the face of so much avoidable death and exploitation, the outrage laid bare across the nine tracks of Rest in Misery is palpable. Prank isn\u2019t as active as they once were, but they always deliver the goods. No exception here, just raging Japanese hardcore with a metallic bent that will make you want to run through a wall. Reviewer Matt Casteel Label Prank Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Stare Kits Live in NYC 1979 LP STARE KITS were an enigmatic, art-leaning minimalist punk quartet that operated on the periphery of New York\u2019s late \u201970s no wave scene\u2014their first show was actually on a May 1979 bill with the similarly-disposed (and also debuting) UT, two strange and striking flowers simultaneously sprouting from the same overgrown garden plot. It turned out to be an incredibly short-lived project (six whole months and three live performances), with a legacy that has largely survived through the web of what its members would later go onto to do, namely vocalist Angela Jaeger relocating to London and joining DROWNING CRAZE and PIGBAG after STARE KITS\u2019 split and drummer Amy Rigby forming the SHAMS in the late \u201980s before a lauded singer/songwriter career. This LP marks the first proper STARE KITS release, with Side A pulled from live tracks recorded at two of the band\u2019s three gigs at the Lower Manhattan post-punk/experimental music hub Tier 3 and rehearsal versions of six of those eight songs making up the flip. The raw, feral energy of the live takes gives them an almost universal edge here\u2014\u201c\u200bIf It\u2019s Red It Can\u2019t Be Black\u201d is STARE KITS at their most classically no wave, as Angela\u2019s vocals waver somewhere between spoken, sung, and incanted over a completely tumbling and halting rhythm, while the doomed guitar-and-poetry intensity of \u201cI See Them From My Window\u201d almost prefigures MECCA NORMAL, and standout \u201cStrength Accumulate\u201d strips bass-driven, UK DIY-style post-punk to an absolutely paper-thin extreme. A footnote in the grand scheme of things, to be sure, but still one worth investigating. Reviewer Erika Elizabeth Label Feeding Tube / Negative Glam Issue MRR #511 \u2022 December 2025 Twenty One Children Ice Cube EP Scrappy, hook-driven punk rock with garage energy and a sneering attitude. TWENTY ONE CHILDREN balance raw distortion with catchy songwriting, keeping things loose but memorable. The EP moves fast, loaded with youthful frustration and sharp humor, recalling classic underground punk while still sounding fresh. A solid reminder that simple punk done right still hits hard. Punk rock directo y pegadizo, con energ\u00eda garage y actitud burlona. TWENTY ONE CHILDREN combinan distorsi\u00f3n cruda con canciones memorables, manteniendo todo simple pero efectivo. El EP avanza r\u00e1pido, cargado de frustraci\u00f3n juvenil y humor \u00e1cido, evocando el punk underground cl\u00e1sico sin sonar pasado de moda.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Destroyer :: Destroyer's Rubies Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close The Blue Nile :: Hats A mosaic of romance and sorrow, Hats evokes a liminal metropolis bathed in the  amber glow of sodium-vapor street lamps, where lonely souls wander down  moonlit alleyways in search of something that has already left them long  ago. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Gene Ammons :: Nice an\u2019 Cool True to Moodsville\u2019s curation, Nice \u2018an Cool is nothing if not a \u201cmood album,\u201d the overall unity of the quartet eclipsing any one section of the arrangement. The band keeps dynamics to a gentle hush; Ammons plays his melody lines straight, keeping embellishments to a bare minimum. Still, the ear can\u2019t help but single out Ammons\u2019 tenor sax. His tone is unmistakable: deep, rich, and warm. He doesn\u2019t so much play notes as he breathes his soul into them, tinting each legato phrase with a lifetime\u2019s worth of dreams and regrets. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Talk Talk :: Spirit of Eden Some records feel impossible to write about. Not because they lack substance, but because they possess too much of it: too much quiet, too much space, too much mystery. They resist language the way water resists a net. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together In 1976 the granola jazzists teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in the sphere, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Jon Hassell / Brian Eno :: Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics The music winds sinuously, like a river in deep, humid tropics. In six tracks which blend seamlessly into one musical entity, this pivotal collaboration from Brian Eno and Jon Hassell explores a mystical, minimalist music, tinted by Southern Hemisphere sounds but also incorporating 20th century electronics. The cuts move slowly but insistently, a sensuous wiggle in their syncopation. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal The Lagniappe Sessions :: Trummors/Prairiewolf Posted on January 16, 2026 January 16, 2026 A meeting of the minds. Last year saw Trummors lit out for the territories touring some esoteric, off-the-beaten path venues in Colorado and New Mexico with Prairiewolf. This installment of the Lagniappe Sessions commemorates the experience with the following collaboration of the two bands reimagining early \u201980s George Strait along with a Joni Mitchell chestnut. The Box Set: An Appreciation, Vol. 1 Posted on January 15, 2026 January 16, 2026 The initial standard for a compact disc was 74 minutes. Legend has it the length was decided upon in order to fit all of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony onto a single disc. In terms of format, the\u00a0arrival and adoption of the CD in 1983 changed not only how we listen to recorded music, but how it\u2019s presented as an art form. No longer beholden to the 22 minute confines of a \u201c12 side, artists began experimenting with the medium\u2026 as did labels. Welcome to the first installment of The Box Set: An Appreciation. L\u00f4 Borges: The Sneaker Album Posted on January 14, 2026 January 13, 2026 L\u00f4 Borges was under immense pressure to record his debut record. The eight songs he had co-composed for Clube da Esquina had the luxury of time to gestate and included contributions from many other musicians in the collective. In contrast, L\u00f4 had very little time to compose and record the songs for his debut, which consisted of fifteen brand new songs, nine of which he was the sole composer. Reissued this month via VAMPISOUL. Glyders :: Forever Posted on January 13, 2026 January 11, 2026 Chicagoans Joshua Condon and Eliza Weber have been Glyders since 2014, but Forever , technically their second album, marks their debut as a trio, with full-time drummer Joe Seger. The trio makes up for lost time, though, blending their Gram Parsons/Byrds/New Riders ballads with surprisingly souped-up scorchers, burned-out breakdowns and best Western boogies. At a time when cosmic country threatens to leave the galaxy entirely, Glyders return it to Earth, while still keeping an eye on the skies. Wussy :: Funeral Dress Posted on January 13, 2026 January 12, 2026 Released twenty years ago, Cincinnati band Wussy\u2019s gritty and homespun debut Funeral Dress established the beginning of a remarkably consistent discography. With a distinctively midwestern blue collar ethos, co-vocalists Chuck Cleaver (of nineties alt-country outfit Ass Ponys) and Lisa Walker deliver a tour de- orce of breakup songs and all sorts of assorted angst. There\u2019s a touch of Lucinda Williams meets Crazy Horse sway in Walker\u2019s leads, while droning guitars make way for Cleaver\u2019s infectiously oft-kilter songcraft. Dylan Day :: The Unanswered Prayer Posted on January 12, 2026 January 11, 2026 Unadorned and strikingly confessional, The Unanswered Prayer flickers humbly at the edge of darkness like a votive, holding space for anyone who might need a little light. Conceived and developed in front of audiences at low-key gigs around LA, Day patiently crafted each piece until the emotional core was revealed. When it came time to put it all to tape, he opted to stay true to the live nature of the music, recording the album straight through in a single half-hour session with only a microphone and a vintage Gibson LG2. Julianna Barwick and Mary Lattimore :: Tragic Magic Posted on January 12, 2026 January 9, 2026 Recorded in Paris, Tragic Magic was sponsored by the InFin\u00e9 label and the Philharmonie de Paris, providing the duo with access to historic instruments from the Mus\u00e9e de la Musique\u2019s instrument collection. And while there are certainly archaic resonances to these lovely cuts\u2014the madrigal purity of \u201cPerpetual Adoration,\u201d the fairy-tale gentleness of \u201cThe Four Sleeping Princesses,\u201d the percussive fervor of round-like, Brian Eno-penned \u201cMelted Moon\u201d\u2014the two musicians also reach for the unknowable future. Will Epstein :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on January 9, 2026 January 8, 2026 Throughout his career, Will Epstein has amassed film scoring credits, including an IDA Documentary Award nomination for his score for Nam June Paik: Moon Is The Oldest TV (2023), by attuning to the micro-moments on screen and crafting the music to match them. So it comes as no surprise that, with the release of his latest lyrics-forward album Yeah, mostly (out on Fat Possum Records), he applies this focused attention as well, sourcing his imagery and subject matter from life\u2019s small moments that may otherwise go unnoticed as a person goes on living. David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar Jazz Posted on January 8, 2026 January 7, 2026 Released 10 years ago today, David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar marked the artist\u2019s most intensive and rewarding collaboration with jazz musicians in the span of his six decade career. To commemorate the album\u2019s anniversary we dive into how his work with Maria Schneider, Donny McCaslin and other players shaped his final record. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on January 7, 2026 January 7, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W It\u2019s Common Knowledge I\u2019ve Been Doin\u2019 Alright: Dan Bejar on \u201cDestroyer\u2019s Rubies\u201d at 20 Posted on January 7, 2026 January 7, 2026 Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Released two decades ago in February of 2006, we caught up with Bejar to discuss all of it \u2026 Elijah Minnelli :: Clams As A Main Meal Posted on January 6, 2026 January 6, 2026 After garnering a reputation for his curated global radio mixes, London-based sound alchemist Elijah Minnelli pieces together a singular fusion of folk, offbeat dub and Cumbia rhythms on sophomore album Clams As A Main Meal . The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Robert Stillman :: 10,000 Rivers Posted on January 6, 2026 January 5, 2026 We live in a world birthed from the techno-utopian visions of people like Apple founder Steve Jobs, who\u2019s the subject of East Kent composer and The Smile collaborator Robert Stillman\u2019s remarkable new album 10,000 Rivers . Synthesizing a web of jazz, smooth \u201980s sounds and modern classical into a whole that works as a provocation, humanizing investigation, and critique all at once.

I had some reservations about grouping these two bands into one post, since really the only thing they have in common is the presence of a female vocalist, but ultimately, I think there can be a point to it. As with any single-gender dominated field, there are two major issues: (1) Only half of the potential talent pool ever even considers taking up the task, and (2) a huge perspective gap may be missing. These two bands are taking an innovative approach to their genres, and I think that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Before I walk further into a minefield, let\u2019s get started. Rolo Tomassi This band popped up in my weekly Spotify playlist, and I was intrigued by the calm math-rockish sound of the featured song (\u201cOpalescent\u201d). I saved the band and went back to it later, and was totally confused when I started the album from the beginning. The first three songs are some pretty heavy hardcore, which seemed totally inconsistent with expectations. This band has at least two distinct faces, so only hearing one is a setup to be fooled later. Hailing from the UK, Rolo Tomassi put out their fourth studio album, Grievances , in 2015. Where their previous album, Astrea (2012) mixed their two-faceness evenly across songs, the new release splits them apart a little more. Vocalist siblings Eva and James Spence share some of screaming duties, and it\u2019s actually pretty difficult to tell who\u2019s up to bat during these sections. It\u2019s probably a little harder to mistake Eva\u2019s excellent clean vocals on the calmer sections, where James is usually focusing on some mesmerizing keyboard and electronic bits. There\u2019s a heavy punk influence throughout, and experimentation galore. In the math rock sections, the drums are often doing some complex polyrhythmic work and the guitar keeps up and somehow fills the beautifully awkward gaps. Their ability to transition between these two faces and still sound like one frantic/beautiful cohesive whole is their ultimate strength. I can\u2019t stress this enough, LISTEN TO BOTH TRACKS!!! Red Handed Denial I came across Red Handed Denial while skimming through my bandcamp feed, where a very unexpected Toilet veteran, Jack Bauer, recently purchased their album Wanderer . I clicked play and was immediately blown away. There\u2019s a fair amount of prog djentyness, a dash of metalcore, and a saturation of pure-fucking-fun; three things that I find myself defending a little too often. This group from Toronto reminds me a lot of Destiny Potato , but somehow feel less like a guilty pleasure band (if such a thing exists). Red Handed Denial released their first EP in 2009 and their first full length in 2013. With this newest release, they have taken great strides in production and memorable songwriting. Every song is catchy (well, except maybe the very pleasant guitar outro track), which leaves me wanting more after a very short album. Vocalist Lauren Babic has a whole bunch of covers on her youtube page , covering similar bands like Protest the Hero , TesseracT , and Periphery (her cover of Rainbow Gravity is particularly stunning [save your Spencer already sounds like a girl jokes {and go fuck yourself}]). I am curious to know why there are relatively few sections of harsh vocals on this album, considering she does it often in her covers, but it\u2019s nice to know that it\u2019s something that can be expanded in future albums. The rest of the band, as should be expected in this genre, are all crazy talented and are a key component of the band\u2019s catchiness. No matter how great the vocals are, they won\u2019t do a thing if there\u2019s nothing behind them. Though they don\u2019t break any barriers in the genre, they are very sharp about how to create great music within its guidelines. I realize this is more of an introduction than an review, since I didn\u2019t really get down and dirty with critiques, but the latest albums from both these bands get a solid 4/5 flaming toilets from me.
