That just sounds like the name of a country musician. Or maybe a high school football star being recruited by every school in the SEC.

The band was basically formed from a local collaboration that grew organically the old school viral way, by word of mouth. (There was no TikTok viral push available back then.)

Norwood & The Knockout Dragout Wednesday, February 18, 2026 By Mayer Danzig Everyone faces challenges in their lives, but few are as fundamental as healthcare\u2014for ourselves, our families, and the people we care about. And healthcare in America has become a double hit: first, the health crisis itself; second, navigating a system that can throw haymakers when you\u2019re already down. Chris J.

Literally. An upstairs neighbor didn\u2019t take proper cold weather precautions, a pipe burst, and water came pouring down into the shop. The damage was devastating. But Charette\u2019s doing what DIY musicians do\u2014skip the pity party, roll up the sleeves, [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Rock , Videos Tagged With: Matt Charette Now & Then: Melissa Carper & Theo Lawrence\u2019s\u00a0Havin\u2019 A Talk\u00a0and the reach of\u00a0Time (The Revelator) Sunday, February 15, 2026 By Tom Osborne Duets are relationship counseling with better suits. Two people, one microphone, and a shared agreement to tell the truth in public as long as it rhymes. Melissa Carper and Theo Lawrence understand the assignment. Their debut duo album\u00a0Havin\u2019 A Talk\u00a0leans into the oldest trick in country music: make the song a conversation, then let the conversation become the plot.

I\u2019m equally certain the second tune was about being away from home and longing to return.

They inked a deal with Fearless in 2024, releasing the EP Messy Star , followed a year later by their full-length debut, Ripe Fruit Rots and Falls. \nThe core of Chokecherry lies in guitarist Izzie A.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37483 Reviews Autumn Embrace Enisum The best part about the album was how well the artists connected visuals with the music. The song titles came to life before my eyes, and I could almost follow the tale by watching with my eyes. The album cover tells a lot about what you might find here in your listening experience\u2026hues of orange leaves tell me it\u2019s mid-fall and the mist that hangs low with mountain spires rising sharply in the background. It\u2019s an inviting scene, but also one that might be marked with danger. Will you step into the forest? The King Is Victorious Lightning Strikes While it's possible to pull off heavy metal in the current age,\u00a0\"The King Is Victorious,\"\u00a0with its Duolingo sentence-like song titles, masterbatory guitar solos, and drawn-out compositions, falls flat. Ancient Throne of Sinister Rites Astral Spear I'd like to see more from this project, so I'll be patently waiting for\u00a0Astral Spear-related news. Fragment Through Hollow Eternity Funeral Skies This was an absolutely fantastic album. Not only is the trio musically gifted at their instruments, they write melodies that are straightforward, high reaching, and just a joy to listen to. Pop this in on a long drive, and the time will pass peacefully. Rituel: Initiation De l'Ab\u00eeme Na\u00eet l'Aube This is an album that will crush your very soul, with equal helpings of death, disease, rot, and the kind of desolation that sinks into your mind and you can\u2019t crawl out of. Once its blackness reaches you, its grip is firm, and can\u2019t be broken. A warning\u2026if you are already feeling bad, this is not the cure. Depths of the Grave Denounced Disgraced Lollipops! Nothing Happened Here Echoes of Amara / Sincerely Yours \"Nothing Happened Here\"\u00a0is a small but mighty sampler to sink your teeth into once your Valentine's Day sweets are gone. The All Seeing Eye Pollard Row Overall, this was an excellent album. At times, it was shrouded in mystery, while at others, the music was right in your face. Even in the latter times, the music has a darkness to it that is hard to describe, but it attracted me like a moth to flame. Wings of the Nightstorm (Reissue) Thus Defiled Whereas the musical style definitely is Black Metal, THUS DEFILED aren\u2019t afraid to venture out into Thrash and/or Heavy metal territory when the songs demand it. That is where the real power lies within THUS DEFILED. Keep The Fire Burning Sacred Leather SACRED LEATHER hail from Indianapolis, which lies in the USA state of Indiana. According to the Metal Archives they play Heavy/Thrash Metal, but I would rather refer to their music genre as being a mix of NWOBHM, Old School Heavy Metal and Eighties Speed Metal. The Lionspirit Imperatore The sound that \u201cThe Lionspirit\u201d is showing off is superb, is exactly what this kind of music needs. The bombastic and epic parts are being blasted through your speakers, which does happen all through the album. Terra Black Magic Tree BLACK MAGIC TREE has the capability to write songs that come from listening to a lot of different bands that have coloured the Rock scene throughout the decades, and they have made it into a beautiful melting pot on \u201cTerra\u201d. Bloody Circuits Creaturelens This album was excellent, and I wish they had a social media account. The synthwave was smooth\u2026even cold at times, but always alive. For those of you who were alive in the 80\u2019s, this will be a sentimental sound. But like all good music, it lives today, not in the past. Shards of a Waking Sun Duchna As the album continued to move, I felt worse and worse, sort of like a cumulative effect of piling one burden on top of another, trying to break me. That\u2019s how powerful the emotional experience was. It\u2019s also an album buried in deep mystery, and if you take the plunge, you never know what you might unearth\u2026what secrets might be revealed. Reden\u00e7\u00e3o Pelas Chamas Reden\u00e7\u00e3o Pelas Chamas I never knew how great black metal in Portuguese sounded up until today. Pestmond Siechknecht Siechknecht\u2019s \u201cPestmond\u201d is one of those albums that make you glad to be alive. It\u2019s tough and bold and it\u2019s also melodic and inspiring. Lidande T\u00e5rf\u00f6dd If the digital only release of T\u00c5RF\u00d6DD\u2019s \u201cLidande\u201d left you a bit peckish, you can now snag its physical cousin via Purity Through Fire. Existence No Terror In The Bang This is an album that\u2019s a study in extremes. On one end, it\u2019s smooth, melodic, and perhaps even introspective at times. On the other end however, it\u2019s aggressive, brutal, even punishing, I feel like five songs was enough to capture the band\u2019s essence, primarily because each of them had a similar sound and a similar length. One thing I would have liked would be a bit more diversity, but I am looking forward to what they might do next. Latest Interviews All 2132 Interviews Markus Lachendro Xfactor1 I took some time recently and sat down with Markus Lachendro, guitarist for the band [\u2026] Micha\u0142 Chro\u015bcielewski, Pawe\u0142 Smarkusz, Monika Chro\u015bcielewska CZART CZART is an experimental metal band hailing from Poland.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Misotheist \u2013 De Pinte Review By Grin Reaper on February 19, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 25 comments \u201cEver shrouded in mystery, the enigmatic collective Misotheist emerges from their icy realm to deliver succor to fans of metals black and arcane. De Pinte , the band\u2019s fourth release, roughly translates from Norwegian to \u2018The Tormented\u2019 or \u2018They Tormented,\u2019 a fitting appellation given the Trondheim troupe\u2019s fondness for tortured topics and twisted themes.\u201d Miso kvlt! Domhain \u2013 In Perfect Stillness Review By Steel Druhm on February 19, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 40 comments \u201cFor the second review in a row, I heard about a band via skimming YouTube, heard something I liked, and tracked down their promo. I\u2019m used to working this from the other direction, but when the almighty algorithm gives, one must take and be thankful. Domhain is an atmospheric post-black metal band from Northern Ireland, and In Perfect Stillness is their debut full-length. With an emotionally charged sound and style, Domhain touches on the past works of Darkest Era , Primordial , and Agalloch while utilizing cellos and haunting female vocals to punctuate the melancholic, often grim moods they wallow in.\u201d Dashed upon the Reefs of Grief. Nytt Land \u2013 Aba Khan Review By Spicie Forrest on February 19, 2026 in Reviews , Folk , Not Metal , 21 comments \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to share my favorite fact about Nytt Land , the Siberian dark folk project from husband and wife, Anatoly and Natalia Pakhalenko. During my research for this review, I came across an old interview with Anatoly. He was discussing instrumental diversity on their then-upcoming release, ODAL . Of all the instruments Anatoly plays, the talharpa, an ancient Nordic bowed lyre, is his favorite. Do you know why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his favorite? BECAUSE HIS WIFE MADE IT FOR HIM. MADE IT. WITH HER OWN TWO HANDS.\u201d DIY for REAL. Sylosis \u2013 The New Flesh Review By Lavender Larcenist on February 18, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Metalcore , Thrash Metal , 34 comments \u201c Sylosis has been quietly plugging along in the background for years, a band that, in my anecdotal experience, many have heard of, but few listen to. When I go to shout about the greatness of albums like Monolith or Dormant Heart from the highest peaks, it seems to fall on deaf ears. No more, I say! Lead vocalist and guitarist Josh Middleton has led the band since Edge of the Earth . As the last remaining original member, he became the de facto songwriter and soul of a group that has seen many members over the years and near dissolution during Middleton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time with Architects . After returning to Sylosis full-time, the band is on their third release in this latest era, The New Flesh .\u201d All hail the new flesh! Desoration \u2013 NON Review By Owlswald on February 18, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Melodic Death Metal , Technical Death Metal , 22 comments \u201cSelf-releasing an album is a monumental effort. Between production, distribution, artwork, press, yadda yadda yadda, the logistical weight quickly consumes vast amounts of time, money and energy. And that\u2019s before you factor in the arduous task of creating music that\u2019s actually fucking good. Indeed, for a young band, initial encounters are everything, which means it behooves one to ensure everything is as polished and professional as possible. Desoration understands this\u201d Self against self. Shine \u2013 Wrathcult Review By Grin Reaper on February 17, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Blackened Death Metal , Death Metal , 11 comments \u201cSomething must be in the water over in Poland, because the country churns out quality death metal like few others. The phrase \u2018Polish death metal\u2019 always grabs my attention, whether it\u2019s technical like early Decapitated , thrashy \u00c3\u00a0 la Vader , or as blackened as Behemoth . Such was the case when I espied Shine \u2019s Wrathcult lying unclaimed in the promo bin.\u201d Hiding light under a cult bushel. Phasma \u2013 Purgatory Review By Kenstrosity on February 17, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Metal , Deathcore , Hardcore , Technical Death Metal , 33 comments \u201cSometimes an album comes around ye olde promo pit that looks and smells familiar, but plays like something else entirely. Today\u2019s entry into the \u201cwhat the heck am I actually listening to?\u201d hall of infamy is Phasma \u2019s Purgatory . The third record from the Greek/US duo, and the first carried by a label\u00e2\u0080\u0094our beloved Transcending Obscurity Records\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Purgatory continually subverted every expectation I had. In doing so, it became one of my biggest pleasant surprises in recent memory.\u201d Set Phasmas to brutal stun. Cattle Hammer \u2013 Dark Thoughts with Lights Out By Spicie Forrest on February 17, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Doom Metal , Drone , Sludge , 29 comments \u201cBased in Birmingham, UK, Cattle Hammer was formed by vocalist/guitarist Duncan Wilkins in 2023. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joined by I Cartwright on drums, J Wyles on guitar, and D Von Donovan on bass. Together, they mix a caustic brew of drone, doom, and sludge, but each track on Dark Thoughts with Lights Out has its own identity.\u201d Hammers for beef. Worm \u2013 Necropalace Review By Thus Spoke on February 16, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Doom , Death Metal , Dungeon Synth , 116 comments \u201c Worm s are rich fodder for metal band names, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. They\u2019re gross, alienlike, and carry connotations of death and decay; and that\u2019s before you start spelling it with a \u2018v\u2019 and thereby reference dragons, sea monsters, and the Devil himself. While sharing the collective imagination, this Worm definitely distinguishes themselves. After a shaky start, it was Foreverglade that first saw Worm realize their potential with a lean towards doom-death that retained just enough synth-forward black metal and balanced a murky soundscape with syrupy sweet guitar solos.\u201d Worm turning? Velothian \u2013 Mythic Dawn Review By Mystikus Hugebeard on February 16, 2026 in Reviews , Atmospheric Black Metal , Black Metal , Folk Metal , 30 comments \u201cIf, like me, you played a lot of the original Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), then you might agree that the game has a nigh unbeatable vibe. The densely forested hills rolling into the distance, the subtle call of a nearby Nirnroot, the grossly overconfident mudcrabs, the endearing jank of two townspeople conversing like they\u2019ve only just discovered human language; it\u2019s a distinctly cozy high fantasy setting that feels like home in a way few modern games could hope to replicate. Thus, I was excited to learn that Velothian , the epic post-black metal act that was previously featured on the 2024 EP Roundup for their Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind -themed EP Path of the Incarnate , now draws from Oblivion as inspiration for their debut full-length, Mythic Dawn .\u201d Scroll goals.

And yet, mutual aid remains a vital resource for oppressed people the world over. Some say punk shouldn\u2019t be political, and to that I say two things.

HUMAN GREED displays their reverence for old school grind while also completely reinvigorating the genre by introducing contemporary sounds and compositions.

Last spring saw the release of Tr\u00e9sor Magn\u00e9tique , the latest posthumous compilation highlighting the works of Cameroonian musicologist, writer, composer, and broadcaster Francis Bebey. Culled from Bebey\u2019s seemingly endless archives by his son Patrick, the collection unearths deep cuts spanning 1974 to 1986. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Wet Tuna :: Vast The musical and psychic evolution of Matt \u201cMV\u201d Valentine traces a wide-ranging and gloriously unwieldy trajectory through sound and space for those intrepid enough to follow it. Spanning the earliest days of Tower Recordings, a bevy of solo albums, one of the most exhaustive and rewarding live recording archives you can dig into, and twenty-five years copiloting the fantastic voyage of MV&EE, Valentine has never stopped pushing the music outward and onward. And it doesn\u2019t get any farther out than the freewheeling funkified flights of Wet Tuna. Read More Spotify Apple Music Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close SOYUZ :: KROK Tracked live to tape at Sessa and Biel Basile\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo studio, Krok captures the Belarusian outfit in a moment of transition, stretching the sinewy tendrils of their earlier work into something more expansive and self-possessed. Where their previous LP steeped itself in the gentle saudade of Brazil\u2019s Clube da Esquina, Krok pulls the lens back as the palette broadens and horizons turn transcontinental. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Joshua Massad & Dylan Aycock :: Two Improvisations More stunning Takoma School ragas from Joshua Massad and Dylan Aycock, whose self-titled 2020 cassette has been in constant rotation over the past few years. This one is the duo\u2019s vinyl debut \u2014 and as the title tells us, we\u2019re invited to luxuriate in two long improvs, both stretching well beyond the 15-minute mark. Read More Spotify Apple Music Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Naujawanan Baidar :: Volume 1 Posted on February 19, 2026 February 19, 2026 Like a \u201967 Velvets drone crackling from a battery-powered transistor radio beneath the Afghan sky, Naujawanan Baidar\u2019s debut cassette evokes a world unto itself. Isolated, resonant, and strangely infinite. Recorded straight to 4-track and released in 2018 via the Netherlands-based label Radio Khiyaban, the 40-minute transmission unfolds like a sub rosa broadcast from another time, as its lo-fi textures and meditative pacing draw the listener into a furtive, half-remembered landscape where the past and present blur into one. Zal Yanovsky :: Alive And Well In Argentina Posted on February 19, 2026 February 19, 2026 Following his departure as lead guitarist of The Lovin\u2019 Spoonful, Alive And Well In Argentina is the curious one-off solo offering from Canadian folk-rock musician Zal Yanovsky. Released in 1968, the record is dripping with sardonic irony from the title and artwork to the ingrained comedy of the originals and covers scattered throughout. Such a novelty hodgepodge (think Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band or the Firesign Theatre) nonetheless includes admirable takes on country and western classics from the likes of Floyd Cramer and George Jones, while other originals present an obtusely frenzied psychedelia with Yanovsky\u2019s unmistakably charismatic touch. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on February 18, 2026 February 15, 2026 Pac\u00edfico Nocturno. Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W SOYUZ :: KROK Posted on February 18, 2026 February 18, 2026 Tracked live to tape at Sessa and Biel Basile\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo studio, Krok captures the Belarusian outfit in a moment of transition, stretching the sinewy tendrils of their earlier work into something more expansive and self-possessed. Where their previous LP steeped itself in the gentle saudade of Brazil\u2019s Clube da Esquina, Krok pulls the lens back as the palette broadens and horizons turn transcontinental. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0446\u044b \u0414\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 :: \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0446\u044b \u0414\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 Posted on February 18, 2026 February 17, 2026 Hailing from Izhevsk, Russia, Samsti Dronta (English translation: Male Dodos) played their first live gig in that fateful year 1991. By all accounts they inhaled contemporary Western influences like Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, and Dead Can Dance. They excavated sounds from industrial materials such as sheet metal and glass. The output from these experiments could have resulted in something harsh, but the sharp edges are balanced with gauzy and beautiful moments. Bill Fay :: From The Bottom Of An Old Grandfather Clock (A Collection Of Demos And Outtakes 1966-1970) Posted on February 17, 2026 February 18, 2026 If you blinked, you might have missed it. Dead Oceans quietly re-released From the Bottom of an Old Grandfather Clock last December\u2014a twenty-five-track journey through Bill Fay\u2019s back pages, loaded with demos and long-forgotten outtakes. Having largely disappeared from public life after the release of 1971\u2019s Time of the Last Persecution , only to reemerge in a quietly triumphant late-career renaissance in 2012, the collection stands as a worthy and necessary addition to the English singer-songwriter and pianist\u2019s enduring oeuvre. Stephen McCraven :: Wooley The Newt Posted on February 17, 2026 February 16, 2026 Originally released on Marion Brown\u2019s Sweet Earth imprint in 1979, Wooley The Newt is a true lost spiritual jazz relic from percussionist and composer Stephen McCraven. Resurrected in a limited capacity by British reissue label Moved-By-Sound at the tail end of last year, the record was sampled by Stephen\u2019s son Makaya on his 2020\u2019s reimaging of Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s I\u2019m New Here . Recorded in Paris and more than long overdue, it\u2019s a fascinating relic of seventies avant-jazz and a lost bandleader debut of the utmost artistic craft. Lala Lala :: Heaven 2 Posted on February 17, 2026 February 16, 2026 Heaven 2 is a road album of sorts, where the Chicago songwriter breaks out for fresh territories. Whether toward or away from something is anybody\u2019s guess. What keeps things real, what keeps them compelling, is the cigarette-ash astringency of LaLa LaLa\u2019s central melodies.\u00a0No matter how far she drives from the big city, her songs will, perhaps, always have a tough urban grit to them. John Renbourn :: Live In Kyoto 1978 Posted on February 16, 2026 February 16, 2026 Recorded during the second of two nights John Renbourn played at Kyoto\u2019s Jittoku Coffeehouse, Live in Kyoto 1978 captures the guitarist in a moment of intimacy and precision. Poised and unhurried, the set finds Renbourn relaxed, patiently threading his repertoire before a hushed, attentive room. A baker\u2019s dozen, these recordings were captured on site by audio archivist Satoro Fujii and unearthed forty years later in 2018 via Drag City. Tucker Zimmerman: In Memoriam (1941-2026) Posted on February 16, 2026 February 15, 2026 On January 17, 2026, the world lost the great Tucker Zimmerman and his wife of more than fifty years, Marie-Claire, to a house fire in Liege, Belgium. He was 84 years old. Though born in the United States, he had been a resident of Europe since 1966. A novelist, poet, folk singer, classical composer, & electronic musician, Zimmerman had a deep and restless career with more than a dozen albums to his name. However, because of his status as an expat, he was largely overlooked in his birth country for most of his lifetime. Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard :: February 2026 Posted on February 15, 2026 February 11, 2026 Freeform transmissions from Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard on dublab. Airing every third Sunday of the month, RFAD on dublab features the pairing of Tyler Wilcox\u2019s Doom and Gloom from the Tomb and Chad DePasquale\u2019s New Happy Gathering. This month, Tyler kicks it off with a mix of recent instrumental favorites, and Chad follows it up with a Valentine\u2019s mix \u2014 broken, belated, and bewildered!\u00a0Sunday, 4-6pm PT. The Elegance of Longing: Prefab Sprout\u2019s Steve McQueen and Jordan: The Comeback Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 There are albums that shimmer with impossible ambition, records that sound like they were beamed in from some parallel dimension where pop music never surrendered its claim to sophistication. In the mid-to-late 1980s, while synthesizers ruled the airwaves and production grew increasingly bombastic, Paddy McAloon was writing songs of such disarming tenderness and linguistic agility that they seemed to exist outside time entirely. With Thomas Dolby\u2019s production expertise, Prefab Sprout created two albums \u2013 Steve McQueen in 1985 and Jordan: The Comeback in 1990 \u2013 that stand as monuments to what pop music can achieve when intelligence and emotion strike up a perfect balance. Tommy Hendrix :: Out Of The Mist (1958) Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 Out Of The Mist (1958) is the lone trace of Tommy Hendrix, a cool-jazz crooner whose biography begins and ends with a solitary release. It\u2019s an obscure album lost to time by an artist who seemingly never existed. Tommy Hendrix is a midcentury ghost, and Out Of The Mist is the sound of his specter briefly passing through our dimension, like a puff of cigarette smoke lingering in a cocktail lounge that nobody has ever set foot in.

    "page_text": "NO CLEAN SINGING - PROPAGATING DARK AND DEVASTATING TONES SINCE 2009 PROPAGATING DARK AND DEVASTATING TONES SINCE 2009 HOME PNW METAL CALENDAR INTERVIEWS ALBUM REVIEWS PREMIERES ABOUT CONTACT US AN NCS INTERVIEW:  BIZARREKULT Interviews No Responses \u00bb Feb 19 2026 photo by Radmila Volchenkova (Here we have a new interview by our Comrade Aleks of Roman V. , mastermind of the Norwegian black metal band Bizarrekult , whose new album is due for release on February 20th \u2014 tomorrow! \u2014 by Season of Mist Underground Activists .) Norwegian project Bizarrekult emerged from the Siberian band Dryados and moved to Oslo with the relocation of its founder, Roman \u201cBizarre\u201d (guitar, bass, vocals). Since then, Bizarrekult has had a virtual \u201cstudio\u201d lineup, which, in addition to Roman , includes guitarist Ignat Pomazkov from the Belarusian doom band Adliga and drummer Alexander Pryakhin , based in Russia. At the same time, Roman maintains a live lineup of local musicians, so the band is fully active. As you noticed due to NCS\u2019 newsletter , Bizarrekult\u2019s third album, Alt Som Finnes (\u201cAll There Is\u201d), is here and it\u2019s marked by a slight hint of moderate progress. The eight new tracks feature both pitch-black traditional black metal, with some post-branches. The material\u2019s sound ranges from uncompromisingly apocalyptic and quite extreme to dreamy, transparent \u201cphilosophical\u201d passages, presented in a softer, more tranquil manner. Incidentally, the album features guest vocals: Yusaf Parvec ( Manes , D\u00f8dheimsgard , Code ) croaked on \u201cBlikket Hennes,\u201d Lina ( St. Petersburg\u2019s Cross Bringer and Predatory Void ) sang on \u201cDr\u00f8m,\u201d and Kim Song Sternkopf ( M\u00f8l and The Arcane Order ) sang clean on the lyrical post-metal farewell \u201cTomhet.\u201d Conceptually, Alt Som Finnes sounds like an introspective, heart-wrenching album, untethered from conventional black metal themes, save perhaps for a profound sense of the inappropriateness of one\u2019s place in a disorganized world. There was no other way but to do this interview with Roman , so you can read almost the entire story of Alt Som Finnes below. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 9:57 am Tagged with: Bizarrekult , Comrade Aleks AN NCS ALBUM PREMIERE (AND A REVIEW):  PRISON OF MIRRORS \u2014 \u201cDE SEPULCHRIS OCCULTIS ET IGNE PROFANATIONIS\u201d Album Reviews , Premieres No Responses \u00bb Feb 19 2026 (written by Islander) De Sepulchris Occultis et Igne Profanationis (Of Hidden Tombs and the Fire of Profanation) is the second album (or EP if you prefer, since it\u2019s on the borderline) from the Italian band Prison of Mirrors . It consists of two very long songs \u2014 \u201c Chants Beneath the Shunned Shrines \u201d and \u201c The Devouring Fire of Demonic Doctrine \u201c. It will be released by ATMF on February 24th . And you can listen to it today through our full streaming premiere. While making references to \u201cthe desolate lines traced by the darkest Blut Aus Nord and Akhlys ,\u201d ATMF describes the record as \u201ca work that is bleak, profound, suffocating, and all-encompassing: a sonic ritual that grants no respite and, like a slow-acting poison, will wound its listeners, consuming both mind and senses\u201d \u2014 \u201ca journey into the core of an abyss with no bottom, where every step drags you deeper, until nothing remains of former memories \u2014 only the faint echo of a consciousness undone.\u201d After that, you\u2019ll be happy to know that the record is survivable, but the mental wounds it leaves won\u2019t heal quickly. The experience is hallucinatory and labyrinthine, and around all of the many strangely curling corners something very unsettling and intense awaits, though the intensity manifests in different ways, leaving different scars.

Recently, quite out of the blue, we received an email asking us \u2013 and I swear I\u2019m not making this up \u2013 to stop using so many words in our reviews and to just boil things down to a score out of 10 at the end of each article so that they were more \u201cuseful\u201d. And while you almost have to admire the sheer gall it takes to contact us directly and ask us to change who we are and what we do purely for someone else\u2019s convenience \u2013 as if that was ever going to elicit a positive response \u2013 it got me thinking about the power of expectations (particularly the wrong expectations) and how important it is to approach things on their own terms. Which brings us, nice and neatly, to the new album from Ingrina .

Also join us in enjoying his reviews of four recommended January releases.) I\u2019ve yelled about how February is a useless fucking month at least once in the past, but this year feels a little different. For me personally, anyway. Yes, you may have noticed that this column is hilariously late compared to my usual cadence, but since I\u2019ve last posted here, I have: Gotten engaged Taken a last-minute trip to New York (I had the advanced notice of 24 hours in business days) Had my byline in Decibel for the first time Suffice to say some curveballs have thrown themselves into my schedule, but it\u2019s not unwelcome. Despite living in a rapidly declining christofascist empire, life is largely good. It\u2019s a very weird time to be happy in your personal life, if nothing else, and that alone is worth something. I also have the privilege of making my return to Roadburn this April, and with the recent announcement of Cult of Luna playing two sets there, I\u2019ll have a hard time thinking about much else for the next two months. God, where was I? Oh, right. Here are another four albums you should really drop everything you\u2019re doing and listen to. Yes, right now.

It\u2019s been a long while hasn\u2019t it? More than six years by my count and I\u2019ve been checked out as a music enthusiast for most of it. I won\u2019t go into why, but I\u2019m ready to come back and talk about some sick metal records, and starting my return to NCS with a Sylosis record feels about as appropriate for me as it gets. Before we get to talking about The New Flesh we ought to talk about my history with this band. I discovered them all the way back when their debut full-length Conclusion Of An Age had just come out, and it blew me away. The commitment to mixing modern metalcore conventions and melodic vocal hooks with an extremely technical and precise thrash approach in the vein of Forbidden , Metallica , Testament , and the like really spoke to me, and it kept me hooked. Sylosis is an all-time favorite band of mine. Edge Of The Earth is one of modern metal\u2019s ALL TIME GREATEST records. I am a fanboy for this band, a simp, and an admirer as a guitarist of Josh Middleton and his commitment as a composer to keeping things melodic, technical, and deep. UNTIL that is, Cycle Of Suffering .

We concluded the introduction by proclaiming, \u201cIt really is one of those songs that\u2019s so emotionally evocative, so viscerally soul-stirring in its impact, that vocals are unnecessary, and indeed would have risked distraction from all the other marvels had they been present.\u201d Coincidentally, we\u2019re now premiering another instrumental metal song, this time from the other side of our continent, and the same impression holds for this one: You won\u2019t miss the vocals at all. What we have for you today is the title song for A Flashing on Plain Glass , the intriguingly named forthcoming third album from the Boston-based instrumental post-metal trio Lesotho .

Most often, the concepts are represented lyrically. Often, the lyrics are written independently of the music, even after much of the music has already been written. Although listening to the riffs and melodies might inspire the lyricist\u2019s development of concepts, sometimes there may be no evident connection at all between an album\u2019s \u201cconceptual framework\u201d and what the songs sound like. Which brings us to a new concept album by the Italian artist Marlugubre . The name of the album is Per Amor Nymphae , and as that title signifies (it translates to \u201cThrough the Love of the Nymphs\u201d), the songs are based upon the mythical figures of nymphs. Deeply rooted in Greek mythology, the songs include tales of the primordial figure of Nyx from Hesiod\u2019s Theogony , of Chloris, of the tragic myth of Scylla and Glaucus, and of perhaps the even more tragic story of Orpheus and Eurydice \u2014 which is the subject of the song from Per Amor Nymphae that we\u2019re premiering today in advance of the album\u2019s February 27 release by Dusktone .

In particular I was looking at the ways in which your (for want of a better term) perspective \u2013 dictated by your social, cultural, and even geographical, influences \u2013 affects your perception of things like language (specifically speech sounds), colour, and more. Why am I mentioning this? Well, it\u2019s because the way we categorise sub-genres also seems to follow a lot of the rules of \u201ccategorical perception\u201d Let\u2019s face it, Death Metal that becomes increasingly more \u201cblackened\u201d until turns into \u201cBlackened Death Metal\u201d can easily just tip over into straight up Black Metal (and vice versa)\u2026 Hardcore combined with Metal becomes \u201cMetallic Hardcore\u201d, which in turn, at some point, becomes \u201cMetalcore\u201d (a term which itself means different things to different people, depending on their background and history), and so on\u2026- to the point where even if the sonic spectrum appears pretty continuous we generally choose to draw some pretty hard lines and separate it into discrete little areas, if only to help us more easily manage the sheer wealth of music we\u2019re exposed to. But what\u2019s really interesting about all that \u2013 to me, anyway \u2013 is the fact that while these sub-genre categories can be a useful tool, sometimes how you choose to categorise a band says more about you than them . Which, of course, brings us to the new album from self-declared \u201cHardcore Punk Metal\u201d crew Killing Pace .

They describe the band as \u201ca death grind assault unit blending the surgical brutality of death metal with the speed, chaos, and ferocity of grindcore\u201d. That description is true, but doesn\u2019t completely capture all the musical ingredients of Abyssurge . Most prominently, Strup\u2019s music is also hideously foul and abysmal as well as maniacally furious and brutally bludgeoning. But you\u2019ll soon see this for yourselves, because today we\u2019re premiering a full stream of this Kyiv band\u2019s debut \u2014 preceded (of course) by our own more detailed thoughts about what you\u2019re about to encounter.

When it comes to vicious hardcore punk, d-beat, and grind records, the label Iron Lung Records reigns supreme. However, it is rare that they release anything that falls more firmly in the metal camp. So when they do put something out that is unquestionably metal, it is something to take notice of. Such is the case with Black Phosphorous Dungeon , the new EP by Cryptid Spawn . When we say that Cryptid Spawn is undeniably metal, we aren\u2019t talking about Judas Priest , not that there would be anything wrong with that. Cryptid Spawn\u2019s leather-gloved hands are sticky with the DNA of the darkest extreme metal forebears. Think early Bathory , Blasphemy , Sarc\u00f3fago , and Hellhammer . \u201cGods of the Grim and Dismal World\u201d shows how they are able to blend the relentless blur of war metal with actual, discernible riffs, the song held together by a primitive but memorable chord progression. The vocals spew blasphemous phlegm in the best possible way, and when the guitars slow down partway through the song, the riff is the best combination of death metal crawl and sludge-ridden filth.It\u2019s an auspicious beginning to a short but devastating release.
