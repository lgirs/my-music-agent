Filed Under: Readers' Pick Tagged With: Melissa Carper , Theo Lawrence The Sky Chiefs \u2013 The Sky Chiefs Thursday, February 12, 2026 By Shawn Underwood You\u2019ve no doubt heard about artists, or their families, who\u2019ve found a trove of lost recordings buried in the back of a closet in some nearly forgotten studio. Springsteen and Jennings come immediately to mind. Typically these are extra tunes that get cut from a record or demos that never really found a home and [\u2026] Filed Under: Alt-Country , Americana , Bluegrass , Country , Reviews Tagged With: The Sky Chiefs Clay Street Unit \u2013 Sin & Squalor Thursday, February 12, 2026 By Shawn Underwood I have no doubt the first secular song ever written was a love ballad. I\u2019m equally certain the second tune was about being away from home and longing to return. Denver\u2019s Clay Street Unit just released their debut full length album, and while they don\u2019t call that out as any kind of unifying theme, a [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Bluegrass , Country Tagged With: Clay Street Unit Listening for the Vanishing Words: James McMurtry at Full Measure Wednesday, February 11, 2026 By Brian D'Ambrosio James McMurtry does not talk much, and he does not volunteer myth. He answers questions carefully, sometimes obliquely, often economically, as if every word costs something. That reserve has become part of his public character, as recognizable as the stark clarity of his songs. McMurtry is a listener first, a keen observer of language and [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Interviews , Singer/Songwriter Tagged With: James McMurtry Patton Magee of The Nude Party on How They Got a Sitar and the Best Kept Secret in Music Tuesday, February 10, 2026 By Mayer Danzig Patton Magee of The Nude Party talks about the benefit of staying busy and recalls what happened when the police showed up at the band\u2019s first gig. Filed Under: Interviews , Rock , Why It Matters Tagged With: Patton Magee , The Nude Party Monday Morning Video \u2013 Tyler-James Kelly Monday, February 09, 2026 By Mayer Danzig The beauty of true country music is its simplicity. But there\u2019s real complexity in creating something that feels effortless\u2014distilling a song idea down to its core, making it lyrically accessible, and setting it to a melody that\u2019s both immediate and unforgettable. Tyler-James Kelly did exactly that on his solo debut, and he continues that success [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Country , Videos Tagged With: Tyler-James Kelly Now & Then: Natalie Del Carmen\u2019s\u00a0Pastures\u00a0and the reach of\u00a0Our Endless Numbered Days Sunday, February 08, 2026 By Tom Osborne Los Angeles is not exactly famous for quiet. It\u2019s famous for traffic that hums in B-flat and palm trees that look like they\u2019re always posing for a headshot. So when a 24-year-old songwriter from L.A. drops an Americana record called\u00a0Pastures, the first surprise is the title. The second surprise is that it actually sounds like one: open air, creaky wood, and time moving at a human speed. Filed Under: Reviews Tagged With: Iron & Wine , Natalie Del Carmen Readers\u2019 Pick: Natalie Del Carmen \u2013 Pastures Friday, February 06, 2026 By Tom Osborne You picked Natalie Del Carmen \u2013 Pastures\u00a0as your favorite new release for the week of January 30, 2026. Filed Under: Readers' Pick Tagged With: Natalie Del Carmen John Francis O\u2019Mara Video Premiere \u2013 Jesus Walked On Water Thursday, February 05, 2026 By Shawn Underwood One of my favorite albums of last year was John Francis O\u2019Mara\u2019s Forbidden Hymns. It\u2019s a plea for humanity to dig deep into their soul and find the empathy and kindness that\u2019s been mocked as a weakness by many in power today. Set to a soundtrack of outlaw country hymns and Southern rock R&B ballads, [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Folk , Reviews , Videos Tagged With: John Francis O'Mara Folk Alliance Int\u2019l 2026 \u2013 Shawn\u2019s Favorites Thursday, February 05, 2026 By Shawn Underwood Folk Alliance International isn\u2019t your typical music conference.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37460 Reviews Cairn Parallel Minds This album was lengthy and the 60+ minutes of run time did seem to have some concept qualities. Their musicianship was excellent, but I found it difficult to really be able to dig into their sound. Normally, I love mashups\u2026this one just didn\u2019t do much for me and just wasn\u2019t overly memorable. All that we hate Putrid All That We\u00a0Hate, the full length LP by the blackened thrash metal band\u00a0Putrid\u00a0from Lima Peru [\u2026] State Dependent Memory Unmother This was a positively creepy and frightening album that used some unconventional techniques, and had some progressive leanings. The tortured sounds were so vivid, you could feel them on your own body. Tread lightly here\u2026I feel it\u2019s like a Pandora\u2019s box that once you open, you can never again close. Impermanence Malefic The newest album by Atlanta, Georgia blackened/death metal band\u00a0Malefic,\u00a0Impermanence,\u00a0definitely has a lot to like about [\u2026] Poisoned Art Space of Variations Space of Variations,\u00a0metalcore band from the Ukraine, blazes through 2026 with their excellent new record\u00a0Poisoned [\u2026] MMXXV Burial Gift Hailing from New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, they self-describe as \u201cblackish.\u201d Their record label further comments: [\u2026] Slay Utterly Carrion Vael Their talent is undeniable, and their fever\u2026off the charts. They weave orchestral and even classical sounds into the album, which is punishing Death Metal. It\u2019s a sophisticated and classy kick to your mouth. Aurora Soror Dolorosa Let me be clear, this isn\u2019t \u201cMetal\u201d in the classical sense of that word. But it still has a heavy, driving beat that can penetrate even the most dubious metalhead. The nostalgia was big for me, and I loved the combination of Cold Wave and Goth. The songs were very catchy as well, emotional, and performed with confidence. Don\u2019t let labels get in the way of your listening experience, because this was fantastic. Mythic Dawn Velothian The Black Metal genre has become quite expansive lately, and VELOTHIAN take full advantage of that. The vocals are pretty straightforward in terms of how they are delivered, but the music takes the album to a whole different place. The \u201cconflict\u201d between the two varying styles actually works very well together. This was an excellent album. Metamorphosis Banisher Overall, the album didn\u2019t pull any punches or stray too far from the path and the seemingly uncompromising vision of the band. If you are in the mood for continued shots of aggression and deep beatings, this is for you. Indestructible Metalodon You know that feeling when you see an album cover, and you just sit there knowing that the music inside is going to be bad or at least entertaining? Sky Eater King Cruel \u201cSky Eater\u201d is everything you\u2019d want from a sophomore album. For Stoner and Doom fans it\u2019s definitely worth checking out. Miserere Crossover So long as symphonic pirate isn\u2019t your bag, this album is sure to please. DeathAssault DeathAssault What I do know is that when DEATHASSAULT tones it down a bit, even becomes a bit of emotional in their approach, \"DeathAssault\" sounds a lot more intense and sincere. When the singer then puts on his clean vocals, you feel that you have entered a whole other world. Sceaduhelm Crippled Black Phoenix Twelve songs overstayed its welcome just a bit, but some of the \u201cfiller\u201d songs helped to tell the story well. The album was dark at its core, but also melodic, and catchy. The dual vocalists helped to keep the album interesting, and it was plenty heavy. Overall, an excellent release. Nocturnal Visions Invictus I know of a few embodiments of a band with the name of INVICTUS, I had never heard of the Japanese version before. That has now been rectified and I can only say that I\u2019m glad to finally have listened to and experienced these Far East Death Metallers. One Scratch One Grub . If you\u2019re not strapped to your chair when seated and using speakers, or haven\u2019t fastened your headphones to you when listening that way, I advise you to get that done immediately. I can\u2019t tell you anything else than that SCRATCH ONE GRUB will blow you and/or your brains away if you\u2019re not careful. Hulders Ritual Slagmaur This was a delightfully commanding album that just didn\u2019t settle for taking prisoners. Indeed, the sound was rich, full, frightening, and even combative at times. Latest Interviews All 2132 Interviews Markus Lachendro Xfactor1 I took some time recently and sat down with Markus Lachendro, guitarist for the band [\u2026] Micha\u0142 Chro\u015bcielewski, Pawe\u0142 Smarkusz, Monika Chro\u015bcielewska CZART CZART is an experimental metal band hailing from Poland. The concept behind their debut album, \u201cCzarty Polskie,\u201d has been controversial not only for the AI debate but for the many references to Polish demonology. On All Hallows Eve, Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with members of CZART to discuss everything from AI to the reasons why metal resonates so much in Poland to whether we are living in the best of times or the worst. Most importantly, they discuss the beloved CZART goat. Sam Graff Agenbite Misery AGENBITE MISERY hails from New Hampshire.

On October 10, 2025, the trio for Ashville, North Carolina release their fifth full-length album, \"Sunsetter,\" via Terminus Hate City. Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with Jacob Curwen (vocals, guitars) to discuss topics ranging from the band's origins to the details of \"Sunsetter\" to AI in metal.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Teutonic Slaughter \u2013 Cheap Food Review By Andy-War-Hall on February 13, 2026 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 3 comments \u201cBecoming a fully-fledged metalhead is when you stop associating German metal with Rammstein and start with Teutonic thrash. There\u2019s something about Germany that just makes thrash metal meaner, dirtier, and nastier than anywhere else, and without Teutonic thrash, extreme metal would likely look very different from where it is today. Knowing and loving this heritage, Germany\u2019s own Teutonic Slaughter throws their feather-capped hat into the ring with their third album, Cheap Food , brandishing both a ridiculous album cover and a conviction to maintain the glory of old school Teutonic thrash metal.\u201d Eat, prey, leave. Scythe \u2013 Boiled Alive Review By Grin Reaper on February 13, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 32 comments \u201cIn the midst of a recent metal deep-dive, Romania\u2019s Scythe skulked out from a Bandcamp back alley and bludgeoned me with the flat side of their blade, knocking me senseless with scuzzy shenanigans. We weren\u2019t graced with a promo for Scythe \u2019s self-released debut, but Boiled Alive packs in so much grimy panache that after my first listen, I had it shortlisted as someThing You Might Have Missed. Rather than wait several months before bringing attention to Boiled Alive , though, I volunteered to burn some midnight oil and write about this quartet from Constan\u00c8\u009ba.\u201d Get in the pot! Slaughterday \u2013 Dread Emperor Review By Tyme on February 13, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Doom Metal , 22 comments \u201cLongtime readers of AMG may remember the last time German OSDM stalwarts Slaughterday graced these digital pages. It was long enough ago that EPs were still getting the full-on review treatment, which enabled Slaughterday \u2019s second release, Ravenous , to land a respectable 3.0/5.0 rating. What I was surprised to discover was the lack of any additional coverage, despite Slaughterday dropping three subsequent long players since then. Whether this fact boils down to a lack of promo or a lack of interest is irrelevant, considering I was able to wrestle Slaughterday \u2019s newest offering of odorous offal, Dread Emperor , from the murkiest depths of the sump.\u201d T.G.I.S. Leatherhead \u2013 Violent Horror Stories Review By Steel Druhm on February 12, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Thrash Metal , 43 comments \u201c Steel is a sucker for a band trying their absolute best to bring back the bountiful glory of the 80s metal sound. Enter Greek retro fiends Leatherhead and their second full-length crusade, Violent Horror Stories . I happened to stumble upon their lead single \u201cV.H.S\u201d while scrolling on YouTube and mistook them for yet another thrash revival group, but I was mistaken. Though this is often speedy, high-energy stuff, it plays out more like a loving nod to the salad days of US power metal than any kind of beer and BO thrash-fest.\u201d No sleep til leather. Greyhawk \u2013 Warriors of Greyhawk Review By Holdeneye on February 12, 2026 in Reviews , Hard Rock , Heavy Metal , Power Metal , 38 comments \u201cWhat a week this has been for Seattle-based, Hawk-themed, team-oriented activities! Not only did I just get to see my beloved Seattle Seahawks reach the precipice of American football via the most awesome post-season arc I could have possibly drawn up, but I also get yet another opportunity to cover my beloved hometown metal heroes, Greyhawk . I\u2019ve written ad nauseam about how I found the band and their brand of hard-rocking traditional metal, and I\u2019ve routinely gushed my appreciation for their commitment to mind-positivity. Yes, it is safe to say that I am a total fanboy. So, it was with a fair bit of trepidation that I sat down with Greyhawk \u2019s third full-length album, Warriors of Greyhawk .\u201d Et tu, Hawk Tuah? Swords of Dis, Serpent Ascending, \u00c3\u0094ros Ka\u00c3\u00b9, Midnight Odyssey \u2013 From the Waters of Death \u2013 A retelling of the Epic of Gilgamesh Review By Thus Spoke on February 12, 2026 in Reviews , Ambient , Atmospheric Black Metal , Black Metal , Blackened Death Metal , Death Metal , Experimental Metal , 39 comments \u201cIn case you\u2019re unfamiliar, The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian poetic narrative, whose first complete form is dated to approximately 1800 BCE. It follows a story of King Gilgamesh and his dealings with gods and other mythic monsters, culminating in a journey for the secret of immortality. What better way could there be to consume this rich, literary epic than have it interpreted by the collection of artists behind From the Waters of Death ? Obscure black/doom duo Swords of Dis ; death metal veteran and experimenter Serpent Ascending ; Neptunian Maximalism \u2019s darker, heavier incarnation \u00c3\u0094ros Ka\u00c3\u00b9 ; and ambient-black dreamer Midnight Odyssey .\u201d Gil Ga Mesh, the perverted son, the holy man! Karloff \u2013 Revered by Death Review By Samguineous Maximus on February 11, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , Punk , 7 comments \u201cAs a musician, sometimes you just want to blow off some steam with a fun, low-stakes side project, free from the genre trappings or expectations of your main gig. Karloff is a band born of such an impulse, serving as the vehicle for Graveyard Ghoul \u2019s Tom \u201cTyrant\u00c3\u00b6r\u201d Horrified to deliver some vintage metal/punk. The band\u2019s last full-length, 2021\u2019s The Appearing , was an enjoyable but unimpressive throwback to the halcyon days of punky heavy metal with a blackened twist. Now Mr. Horrified and his team storm back from the grave with another fist-swinging slab of tight, nostalgia-soaked riffage, built to crack open some beers and rattle your damn crypt to rubble.\u201d Universal monsters. Stuck in the Filter: November/December 2025\u2019s Angry Misses By Kenstrosity on February 11, 2026 in Reviews , Stuck in the Filter , Death Metal , Deathcore , Djent , Experimental Metal , Folk Metal , Heavy Metal , Melodic Death Metal , Progressive Metal , Symphonic Metal , Synthwave , Technical Death Metal , 63 comments 2025 is fading in the rearview, but the Filters still need scrubbing. See what was left over after all the holiday debauchery. Fossilization \u2013 Advent of Wounds Review By Steel Druhm on February 11, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 0 comments \u201cBack in 2023, Brazilian death crew Fossilization dropped their Leprous Daylight debut on the unsuspecting world below, impressing Cherd in the process with its Incantation -esque blend of ghastly cavern crawling and 5-ton doomy digressions. He even went so far as to suggest it was superior to Incantation \u2019s then-new platter Unholy Deification while generally singing the praises of preserved beast bone recovery. Fast-forward a few years, and the band\u2019s sophomore release, Advent of Wounds , falls to me as Cherd has gone missing in a very nonsuspicious way that does NOT require police involvement or any half-assed internet sleuthing of any kind\u201d Digging for cave bones. Petrale \u2013 Goat at Sunset Review By Alekhines Gun on February 10, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 41 comments \u201cHailing from Croatia, one-man black metal project Petrale have arrived with some creepily straightforward artwork and an equally straightforward album title; will this be relegated to your ever-flowing streams, or have you reaching for your wallets?\u201d Goat on a black lake at sunrise.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Wet Tuna :: Vast The musical and psychic evolution of Matt \u201cMV\u201d Valentine traces a wide-ranging and gloriously unwieldy trajectory through sound and space for those intrepid enough to follow it. Spanning the earliest days of Tower Recordings, a bevy of solo albums, one of the most exhaustive and rewarding live recording archives you can dig into, and twenty-five years copiloting the fantastic voyage of MV&EE, Valentine has never stopped pushing the music outward and onward. And it doesn\u2019t get any farther out than the freewheeling funkified flights of Wet Tuna. Read More Spotify Apple Music Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close The Ibrahim Khalil Shihab Quintet :: Spring Recorded in the late 1960s by Cape Town pianist Ibrahim Khalil Shihab and his group, Spring calls to mind Atlantic-era Coltrane at its breeziest, with saxophonist Winston \u2018Mankunku\u2019 Ngozi fluttering above the steady, sunny backing. Though it has to be said that this collection of musicians could get heavy if need be; check out the masterfully moody vibe they bring to \u201cBirds,\u201d a ten-minute homage to Trane\u2019s \u201cSpiritual.\u201d Read More Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal The Elegance of Longing: Prefab Sprout\u2019s Steve McQueen and Jordan: The Comeback Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 There are albums that shimmer with impossible ambition, records that sound like they were beamed in from some parallel dimension where pop music never surrendered its claim to sophistication. In the mid-to-late 1980s, while synthesizers ruled the airwaves and production grew increasingly bombastic, Paddy McAloon was writing songs of such disarming tenderness and linguistic agility that they seemed to exist outside time entirely. With Thomas Dolby\u2019s production expertise, Prefab Sprout created two albums \u2013 Steve McQueen in 1985 and Jordan: The Comeback in 1990 \u2013 that stand as monuments to what pop music can achieve when intelligence and emotion strike up a perfect balance. Tommy Hendrix :: Out Of The Mist (1958) Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 Out Of The Mist (1958) is the lone trace of Tommy Hendrix, a cool-jazz crooner whose biography begins and ends with a solitary release. It\u2019s an obscure album lost to time by an artist who seemingly never existed. Tommy Hendrix is a midcentury ghost, and Out Of The Mist is the sound of his specter briefly passing through our dimension, like a puff of cigarette smoke lingering in a cocktail lounge that nobody has ever set foot in. Apparat :: A Hum of Maybe Posted on February 12, 2026 February 11, 2026 For the last two and a half decades, Apparat\u2019s Sascha Ring has been moving from austere, minimalist techno towards a lusher, though still beat-driven sound. A Hum of Maybe continues this trend, its pulse softened with pensive piano, trombone and fluttering voices. Momoko :: Momoko Gill Posted on February 12, 2026 February 11, 2026 \u201cNo Others\u201d lurches and glides, its stuttering rhythm anchored by acoustic bass and skittering snare, its vocal melody light and fluid.\u00a0The London-based Gill taps into bossa nova, tropicalia and fusion jazz on this and other tracks, blowing out phrases as iridescent as soap bubbles over hip-grinding, body-moving cadences.\u00a0This first single from the multi-instrumentalist and composer is layered but unencumbered. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on February 11, 2026 February 10, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Wet Tuna :: Vast Posted on February 11, 2026 February 10, 2026 The musical and psychic evolution of Matt \u201cMV\u201d Valentine traces a wide-ranging and gloriously unwieldy trajectory through sound and space for those intrepid enough to follow it. Spanning the earliest days of Tower Recordings, a bevy of solo albums, one of the most exhaustive and rewarding live recording archives you can dig into, and twenty-five years copiloting the fantastic voyage of MV&EE, Valentine has never stopped pushing the music outward and onward. And it doesn\u2019t get any farther out than the freewheeling funkified flights of Wet Tuna. The Beach Boys :: We Gotta Groove \u2013 The Brother Studio Years Posted on February 10, 2026 February 10, 2026 There is something undeniably miraculous about We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years . Here, after nearly half a century, is not just a presentation of some of the strongest, strangest music Brian Wilson would ever record, but a celebration of it. In the late 1970s, many of these songs were dismissed out of hand as the work of a diminished artist, a man irrevocably changed by years of milkshakes and mental anguish. This reading was not entirely incorrect: the Brian of 1977 was indeed a different person. But as an artist, he was in full flower\u2014more truly himself than he ever had been, and perhaps ever would be. Tony Joe White :: The Real Thang (Deluxe Edition) Posted on February 10, 2026 February 9, 2026 \u201cShe had disco sucks on the front of her t-shirt, a longneck bud in her hand\u2026\u201d  So sings Tony Joe White on \u201cRedneck Women,\u201d courtesy of his eighth long-player, 1980\u2019s The Real Thang . Core purveyor of the swamp rock amalgam alongside Bobby Charles, Lonnie Mack, Dale Hawkins, and Link Wray, White dropped this eight track album on Casablanca Records at the dawn of a new decade. Disco may have been in the ether, but this is swamp music mutating in real time. The Sha La Das :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on February 9, 2026 February 9, 2026 Sometimes a photograph can transport you back in time. On the cover of Your Picture , the second album from Staten Island soul combo The Sha La Das, appears a picture of the family matriarch, Linda. It was the same case with 2018\u2019s Love in the Wind . The photos were taken by the 79-year-old Bill Schalda, who fronts The Sha La Das with his sons, Paul, Will and Carmine. Though aged by time, these images present a different world, but one that Schalda says feels as real and immediate to him as the present. Honey Slides VI :: Shakey Covers Posted on February 9, 2026 February 6, 2026 Slip into the latest edition of our annual mix of rarities and oddities from the far-out reaches of the Shakeyverse. This year, we\u2019ve taken the opportunity to, er, shake things up with an hour\u2019s worth of weird/wonderful Neil covers stretching from the early 1970s to the present day. A\u00a0fun listen with plenty of highlights: Paris 1942 (with Moe Tucker on drums!) brutalizing \u201cRevolution Blues,\u201d Human Instinct\u2019s Muswell Hillbillies-esque \u201cEverybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\u201d Winged Wheel\u2019s instrumental flight through \u201cDanger Bird,\u201d Joan Shelley\u2019s gorgeous \u201cLittle Wing\u201d \u2026 and on and on! The Lagniappe Sessions :: The Nude Party Posted on February 9, 2026 February 10, 2026 The Nude Party return this month with the release of their latest\u2014and fourth\u2014LP, Look Who\u2019s Back . Produced by Michael Rault in the desert at his studio in Joshua Tree, the seven-piece outfit boots up, gets loose, and locks in over the course of the record\u2019s nine tracks. Keeping with the vibe, this installment of the Lagniappe Sessions catches up with the band as they pay tribute to 3\u2011Track Shack era, North Carolina godhead Link Wray, the mutable, perennial gem that is Chuck Willis\u2019s \u201cC.C. Rider,\u201d and the road-worn groove of \u201cSix Days on the Road.\u201d Cat Power :: What Would the Community Think at 30 Posted on February 6, 2026 February 6, 2026 By 1996, Chan Marshall had already recorded two lo-fi albums\u2014 Dear Sir and Myra Lee \u2014with Steve Shelley and Tim Foljan and moved from her native south to New York City. She had just turned 24 when she holed up at Easley Studios in Memphis to record album number three with the same team, her first time recording in a professional space. And while 1998\u2019s Mood Pix would serve as her breakout, this Matador debut captures the wild, raw, unfiltered power of Marshall\u2019s art, an unpredictable electricity that runs through the songs, buzzing and fizzing and threatening explosion at any time. Wilder Maker :: The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Posted on February 6, 2026 February 6, 2026 Songwriter Gabriel Birnbaum\u2019s latest with Wilder Maker, 2025\u2019s The Streets Like Beds Still Warm , leans into sophisto-pop shaded indie pop noir, careening from rootsy swagger into bursts of digital space jazz and ambient funk. Birnbaum narrates like a streetwise-type who\u2019s been up way too long, finding warped and engaging hooks around every corner. He joins us to discuss.

Born from the ashes of the thrash band Madsher , Exorcised have devoted their hellish energies to the creation of old school death thrash, taking their cues from such bands as Deicide , Morbid Angel , and Devastation . Today we have an example of the infernal sonic madness they\u2019ve created through our premiere of a lyuric video for a song from their debut full-length named \u201c Hatred Knife \u201c. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 8:55 am Tagged with: Exorcised AN NCS VIDEO PREMIERE:  DEIMLER \u2014 \u201cDARKNESS FALLS\u201d Premieres 1 Response \u00bb Feb 13 2026 (written by Islander) In 2023 the Spanish death metal band Deimler released a concept album named Immortalized that was based on Ridley Scott\u2019s groundbreaking 1979 movie Alien . Following that up, guitarist/vocalist Pako Deimler decided to pay tribute to a personal favorite series from the \u201990s \u2014 The X-Files . More specifically, Deimler\u2019s new album, Darkness Falls , is based on one episode from the show\u2019s first season that itself was named \u201cDarkness Falls\u201d. That was a standalone episode in which Mulder and Scully went looking for a group of loggers missing in the Olympic National Forest in Washington State (which coincidentally isn\u2019t far from the HQ of our site), only to be confronted by a deadly form of mutant insects. Pako has said that he loves that episode in particular because of its \u201catmosphere\u201d but also because it\u2019s \u201cone of the few episodes where the main characters have a hard time and are truly in great danger.\u201d The new album is now set for release on March 20th by Awakening Records , and what we have for you today is the premiere of a lyric video for its second single \u2014 the title track \u201c Darkness Falls \u201c. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 7:56 am Tagged with: Deimler AN NCS INTERVIEW:  GUYO\u00d0 Interviews No Responses \u00bb Feb 13 2026 (Below you will find our Comrade Aleks\u2019 interview with guitarist Dohrn from the Austrian metal band Guyo\u0111 , whose new EP was released late last month.) The Austrian band Guyo\u0111 announced themselves in 2023 with their debut, Heart of Thy Abyss . That furious work, at the intersection of extreme death metal and doom, unpolished and thunderous, was imbued with the poetry of Charles Baudelaire and Herman Melville, lending the album a special charm. Their up-to-date half-hour-long release, Death Throes of a Drowning God , which another band would list as a full-length album, is considered by Guyo\u0111 to be an EP. This mini-album consists of four full-length tracks, each nearly six minutes long, and four noise drone interludes, collectively titled \u201cSignal,\u201d but with a numbered designation. Regardless, Guyo\u0111 , ignoring convention, delivers listeners dark, concentrated, and meaty stuff. According to the band, one of the ideas behind the EP was to create more disturbing and savage material compared to their first album, and they have succeeded in this quest. This time, the celebration of chaos and madness is presented in the form of vigorous, monstrous death metal with a touch of extreme doom and black metal. At times (\u201cBehind the Walls of Ice\u201d), one is tempted to use the adjective \u201cavant-garde,\u201d but that would be pretentious\u2026 but why not? This feast of entropy has its share of deceptive calm, as in the track \u201cHestia Drowning,\u201d but there are also poignant moments. Guyo\u0111 have taken a creative approach to such a relatively short work, and if you\u2019re looking for a little shake-up, check out this EP. And yet I hate to talk about how I see the music, especially when there\u2019s a chance to talk with its author. Another interview with Dohrn (guitars) is here before you.

Fear of such creatures has led to episodes of mass hysteria, executions, the exhumation and decapitation of corpses, and of course the staking of suspected revenants through the heart. (Many such incidents and more are documented in Killing the Dead: Vampire Epidemics from Mesopotamia to the New World , an exhaustive scholarly work by John Blair published just last November.) Vampirism lives on in our imaginations (hopefully, only there), itself a deathless dream that the passage of millennia can\u2019t exorcise. In our tiny corner of modern culture, black metal has kept the nightmares alive more than any other sub-set of metal, and one of the most prolific exponents over the last seven years has been the Ecuadorian band Wampyric Rites . This band\u2019s newest album, Under the Tragic Fullmoon of the Vampire , is now set for release by Inferna Profundus Records tomorrow \u2014 Friday the 13th of February \u2014 and on the eve of that dreadful event we have a full stream of the album for your consideration.

As I\u2019m sure other writers here at No Clean Singing would agree, most record announcements or press releases eventually become like white noise. You feel like you can predict the claims and wording of it being the \u201cbest album we\u2019ve made yet\u201d; or, especially in metal, depending on the genre, the claim that the music is \u201cthe most brutal thing you will hear all year.\u201d However, when I read about the upcoming release of Transcend Into Oblivion , none of these traps were set, and I knew I\u2019d be eager for this conversation. During a succinct and relaxed time of conversation with Bakka , vocalist and guitarist of Necrofier , I aimed to hear a bit more about the creative process involved in the detailed song structure that is Transcend Into Oblivion , as well as the recent move to Metal Blade Records.

And while this process hasn\u2019t always gone smoothly \u2013 there have been at least a handful of bands over the years who haven\u2019t taken kindly to my coverage, even though it always skews positive, because they didn\u2019t think I praised them enough \u2013 generally speaking I\u2019m proud of the fact that I\u2019ve helped spread the word about our vibrant, versatile \u201cscene\u201d\u2026 even if that \u201cscene\u201d hasn\u2019t always been kind to me in return. Today\u2019s triptych of recent and/or upcoming albums features a promising, if imperfect, debut ( 1986 ), an extremely ambitious second album that serves as something of a creative reboot/rebirth ( Unmother ), and the latest release in a long-running, uncompromising career of unrepentant ugliness ( Moloch ), all of which come with my personal recommendation.

The beauty of loving different genres of music, and in particular, different genres of metal, gives us the opportunity and a benefit of reaching out for precisely that single piece of music that befits our current state of mind. Be it something hellishly heavy, calmingly droning, or just something in the middle, no one can argue that the selection of riches is not adequate. We are talking about decades upon decades of talented musicians spoiling us for choice. Moving through those boundless vasts, we are today travelling to Spain for a fresh dose of black metal conjured in the deepest dwellings of the psyche tailored for anyone bearing a heavy mind, courtesy of Ultima and their just released debut album I: Katabasis .

So is this further introductory comment: On one side: Forcefed Horsehead , weaponizing grindpunk, death metal, hardcore and hysteria with apocalyptic precision. On the other: Shaving the Werewolf , twisting powerviolence, noise rock, nu-metal and mathcore into something deeply uncomfortable and disturbingly catchy. Together, it\u2019s all bruises, whiplash, and creative malpractice of the highest order. To back up these words, what we have for you today (along with introductory comments of our own) is a full stream of Horrid to Worse in all its apocalyptic and poisonous glory.

Today we\u2019re presenting the second single, \u201c Presence:Absence \u201c. To set the stage for it, we\u2019ll quote again from \u00d8rb\u2019s description of the album\u2019s dystopian sci-fi theme \u2014 which focuses on a very real and urgent phenomenon: The full-length album follows a lone resistance figure in a dystopian future where humanity teeters on the brink of extinction under the omnipotent grasp of The Nexus \u2013 an advanced AI network that has reduced humanity to obedient cogs in a machine-driven existence. Armed only with unwavering principles and the history of humankind, this stoic survivor embarks on a perilous journey to challenge the AI overlord. The album\u2019s narrative arc traces a revolt that may be liberation\u2014or only another loop in the machine. Central questions drive the work: Can fate be overcome? What remains of human identity when autonomy is stripped away? Does a belief in determinism empower or limit us? These aren\u2019t abstract philosophical exercises\u2014they\u2019re survival questions in an age where AI increasingly shapes human experience. The project stands with one boot in tomorrow\u2019s wasteland and one in the world we already feel tightening around us, creating a parable about resistance that resonates beyond the boundaries of extreme metal.

This time around, however, I\u2019m (just) ahead of the game, as their new album, De Venom Natura , is set to come out this Friday, meaning I get the chance to help set your expectations ever so slightly in advance. So, without further ado\u2026 let\u2019s see where this bridge takes us, shall we?
