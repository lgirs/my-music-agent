And there are those that do something special. Cold Chocolate are firmly in the latter category. The Boston duo blend folk, rock, funk and bluegrass into something that honors tradition while kicking up a ruckus with scruffy guitar and driving rhythms.

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37417 Reviews Guerre Et Paix Via Doloris Overall, this was a good album. It wasn\u2019t too aggressive or dark, and you could also clearly hear some nice bass work. I also found it to be as advertised\u2026leading melodies with Folk echoes, and they did show restraint in the album. Obsidian Cult Hollow Peak Norse heavy metal band\u00a0Hollow Peak\u00a0released their debut LP\u00a0Obsidian Cult\u00a0on January 23, 2026. This album impressed [\u2026] Thou Hast Done Nothing Nornes French doom/death metal band\u00a0Nornes\u00a0released their newest album\u00a0Thou Hast Done Nothing\u00a0on December 2, 2025. It's an [\u2026] Planned Obsolescence Only Human This was an outstanding Progressive album, and in many ways, it might point towards where the genre is headed for the future. The band has some serious chops, but they don\u2019t overtake the sound, which is heavily focused on an emotional impact. It kept moving forward\u2026branching out, exploring, uncovering rocks that used to be a permanent part of the scene, and each transition was completely smooth. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Same Drug New High Gluecifer I don\u2019t care what your status is emotionally, if \u201cSame Drug New High\u201d doesn\u2019t make you feel better than I haven\u2019t got a clue what will. I know that every time I listen to this GLUECIFER album I get a big smile on my face, start tapping my foot and nodding my head. Welcome back!! Apocalypse Inc Frozen Factory The eclectic mix of styles and musical directions actually works on \u201cApocalypse Inc\u201d, the fourth album by FROZEN FACTORY. Somehow, they have adopted the ability to make all the different angles come together in a way that the blending is almost unnoticeable, but still very much present when you really take a listen. Equinox Equilibrium When I saw this on the to do list of METAL TEMPLE, the combination of musical styles had me intrigued. That is why I requested this review as mine. I like some Metalcore, just as I love some Folk Metal, but they have to get it right to get me really going. The question that I will be asking myself here is whether EQULIBRIUM has the ability to mix them in such a way that it will blow me away. Ready To Fight Cremate \u201cReady to Fight\u201d is the rebirth of CREMATE, a band forged in the Athens underground of the early 90s. Built on the foundation of their cult demo \u201cEnd of Time\u201d (1993), this EP reimagines the raw Death/Thrash spirit of the past with a modern twist weaving in dark synths, samples, and atmospheric textures without losing any of the aggression. Killerdemons Borrower BORROWER and their record companies Octopus Rising / Argonauta Records state on the EPK that they play Progressive Metal, and I\u2019ll admit that this genre is part of their sound, but I need to add a bit of Alternative Rock, a bit of Sludge and a smidgeon of Industrial as well. Qroba Ennui Overall, the best part of the album was trying to decide if it was nearly void of all emotion, or bursting alive with it, and that depends on the listener\u2019s perspective. It was composed in a way that it could go either direction. Last Light Fades Graves For Gods This was a positively dreadful album, in every positive meaning of that phrase. An ominous feeling of doom kept increasing as the album moved, akin to getting another piece of bad news on top of another. By the end, I just felt defeated, and totally slave to its charms. Break the Silence Beyond The Black German symphonic metallers\u00a0Beyond The Black\u00a0have made quite a name for themselves. Since 2015,\u00a0Beyond The Black [\u2026] Hell Interface Nightmarer Dissonance... OooOoooOo E.R.I.S. Goatsmoker GOATSMOKER is the perfect name for this band and \u201cE.R.I.S.\u201d is a perfect reliquary of their latest collection bitumen-soaked Doom. Inexorable Opposites Jack Harlon & The Dead Crows The Jack Harlon saga continues with \u201cInexorable Opposites,\u201d a little older and wiser and maybe more somber than previous iterations. Borrowed Time Altared States ALTARED STATES was actually formed in 1989, only to be disbanded in 1990. The made their return in 2019, and have been around ever since. On \u201cBorrowed Time\u201d they give us the time to embrace 5 songs. Portentum Imperial Domain I have to say that IMPERIAL DOMAIN has that undefinable trait which makes you like what they do. What is remarkable is that it doesn\u2019t matter if what the band is good or not. Evocations Red Sands As far as \u201cEvocations\u201d goes i believe that this band is at tis best when they let their Metal hearts speak, with or without Symphonic and/or Epic elements. Latest Interviews All 2132 Interviews Markus Lachendro Xfactor1 I took some time recently and sat down with Markus Lachendro, guitarist for the band [\u2026] Micha\u0142 Chro\u015bcielewski, Pawe\u0142 Smarkusz, Monika Chro\u015bcielewska CZART CZART is an experimental metal band hailing from Poland. The concept behind their debut album, \u201cCzarty Polskie,\u201d has been controversial not only for the AI debate but for the many references to Polish demonology. On All Hallows Eve, Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with members of CZART to discuss everything from AI to the reasons why metal resonates so much in Poland to whether we are living in the best of times or the worst. Most importantly, they discuss the beloved CZART goat. Sam Graff Agenbite Misery AGENBITE MISERY hails from New Hampshire. In February 2026, the band will be releasing their debut album, \"Remorse of Conscience.\" The album is an experimental metal interpretation of \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce.

Stefano Fiorelli Warcoe WARCOE hails from Pesaro, Italy. Formed in 2021, following the year of our plague, the Doom trio has been blazing a trail through the Italian Doom scene with one monumental album after the other. On September 26, 2025 they released their third full-length album, \u201cUpon Tall Thrones,\u201d which not only weighed in at 8/10 on the Metal Temple scales but hit #1 on Doom Charts for September 2025. This month Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, was able to catch up with Stefano Fiorelli (guitars, vocals) to discuss the origin story of WARCOE, details of their latest album, and even speculate on the impacts of AI and streaming platforms. Jacob Curwen All Hell All Hell has been described as a Blackened Thrash band, but they are much more. On October 10, 2025, the trio for Ashville, North Carolina release their fifth full-length album, \"Sunsetter,\" via Terminus Hate City. Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with Jacob Curwen (vocals, guitars) to discuss topics ranging from the band's origins to the details of \"Sunsetter\" to AI in metal.

    "page_text": "Angry Metal Guy - Metal Reviews, Interviews and General Angryness Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Blog Reviews Interviews About Contact FAQ Lord of the Lost \u2013 Opvs Noir Vol 2 Review By ClarkKent on February 3, 2026 in Reviews , Gothic Metal , Industrial Metal , Pop Metal , Symphonic Metal , 17 comments \u201cLittle did I realize when Napalm announced that Lord of the Lost was recording a 33-song trilogy that each album would release so close to one another. A mere four months following the release of Opvs Noir Vol 1 , we get Opvs Noir Vol 2 , and it\u2019s just in time for stocking stuffer season. Vol 1 was my introduction to this one-time Eurovision finalist, and I came away impressed. So I was pretty excited to see this in the doldrums of our December promo bin. With the quick release of Vol 2 , I can only assume Lord of the Lost wrote all 33 songs of the trilogy together, Lord of the Rings -style.\u201d Lots of lost. Rave in Fire \u2013 Square One Review By Holdeneye on February 3, 2026 in Reviews , Hard Rock , Heavy Metal , 45 comments \u201cThe 80s feel like my own personal primordial, mythological paradise, a Garden of Eden to which I can never return. The gate is eternally guarded by a cherub wielding a flaming sword, but thanks to bands like Rave in Fire , I need not risk being divinely smote in order to feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m back in the garden, all innocent, naked, and happy.\u201d Naked in the rave garden. Backengrillen \u2013 Backengrillen Review By Tyme on February 3, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Punk , 26 comments \u201cAs this new year has gotten off to a right proper, lunacy-fueled start, I scoured the sump pit in search of something to pen my first review of 2026 on. As I poked through the pickens, slim as they were, I spied one of my favorite tags: \u2018 Steel says review,\u2019 sitting unclaimed. Self-described as \u2018free form death-jazz,\u2019 Ume\u00c3\u00a5, Sweden\u2019s Backengrillen play music that is a paean to chaos and destruction. The basic idea is to take a death/doom metal, or noiserock riff and play it until it loses meaning and then break it apart like a ravenous cat would a tiny forest mouse. Okay, I thought, I\u2019ll bite.\u201d Business in the front, grillen in the back. Defaced \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Icon Review By Kronos on February 2, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 43 comments \u201c Icon , the third record form Switzerland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Defaced , comes wrapped up in a characteristically Olofsson-ey work and, much like the cover, is decidedly human, if a bit unambitious. Defaced have re-emerged more than a decade for good reason; a record\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of carefully-crafted death metal.\u201d Re-Defaced. Ritual Arcana \u2013 Ritual Arcana Review By Saunders on February 2, 2026 in Reviews , Doom Metal , Hard Rock , Occult Rock , 10 comments \u201cwhile wading through the promo sump, I stumbled across the self-titled debut of fresh project, Ritual Arcana . Soon discovering this seasoned power trio feature none other than the legendary Scott \u2018Wino\u2019 Weinrich ( Saint Vitus , The Obsessed , Spirit Caravan ), wielding his scuzzed-up axe alongside Sharlee LuckyFree (ex- Moth ) on bass and vocals, and drummer Oakley Munsen ( The Black Lips ).\u201d Hobo Wino! Coronatus \u2013 Dreadful Waters Review By Andy-War-Hall on February 1, 2026 in Reviews , Folk Metal , Symphonic Metal , 21 comments \u201cLike a sailor\u2019s call to the sea, I am routinely compelled to the sub-genre of symphonic metal in all of its be-corset-ed miscellany. Why? Maybe I need a break from dudes singing ugly for ladies singing pretty. Maybe falling for Seven Spires justified my continued curiosity in the style. Maybe I\u2019ve never been as happy as I was discovering Imaginaerum in high school. Regardless, the call brought me now to the German symphonic group Coronatus and their new record, Dreadful Waters .\u201d Symphonies of Same Ness. Vesseles \u2013 Home Review By ClarkKent on January 31, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Symphonic Metal , 23 comments \u201cIn the metalverse, there are plenty of unique personas, and now we can count Valira Pietrangelo among them. She has been very open in interviews about suffering from identity dysphoria. As a result, she dove into making music and eventually discovering herself as a demon. What better way to express your newfound demonhood than through black metal? Everything about Vesseles (pronounced veh-sel-is) revolves around Pietrangelo\u2019s identity.\u201d Demons in the details. Turbo\u2019s Tribunal \u2013 Mills of Tribunal Review By Grin Reaper on January 30, 2026 in Reviews , Heavy Metal , 13 comments \u201cMelodic heavy metal outfit Turbo\u2019s Tribunal heralds the arrival of Mills of Tribunal , hoping to light a fire that warms the dark recesses of our cynical hearts. Hailing from Denmark, Turbo\u2019s Tribunal is the invention of mastermind and sole contributor Andreas Thunbo. Having toiled on demos, EPs, and splits over the last couple of decades, Mills of Tribunal presents Thunbo\u2019s first full-length endeavor. Citing legendary acts like Iron Maiden , Judas Priest , and Running Wild as creative touchstones, can Turbo\u2019s Tribunal live up to the lofty expectations.\u201d Turbo-tastic? M\u00c3\u0098L \u2013 Dreamcrush Review By Killjoy on January 30, 2026 in Reviews , Alternative , Black Metal , Shoegaze , 77 comments \u201cOne of the common complaints I see about blackgaze is that it tends to be toothless when compared to its black metal forebear. This is part of the personal appeal to me, but, in any case, Denmark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s M\u00c3\u0098L has built a reputation for bucking that trend. They managed to impress even hardened metalheads like Mark Z. , who found their 2018 debut, Jord , biting enough to shake him from his blackgaze apathy.\u201d Buck deez nutz. Under \u2013 What Happened In Roundwood Review By Samguineous Maximus on January 29, 2026 in Reviews , Experimental Metal , Noise Rock , Sludge Metal , 20 comments \u201cThere\u2019s something tantalizing about the brand of metal-adjacent noise rock that\u2019s experienced a renaissance in recent years. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ugly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loud, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a damn if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comfortable. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got breakout stars Chat Pile dragging n\u00c3\u00bc-metal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bloated corpse through the mud, Couch Slut dishing out dissonant, riff-heavy nightmare fuel, and Intercourse sounding like a feral animal tearing flesh for fun. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009crevival\u00e2\u0080\u009d music; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bands weaponizing noise, smashing metal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brute force into punk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional hemorrhaging, and then deliberately breaking whatever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left just to see it scream. Enter the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Under , stepping into this mess with zero interest in playing nice.\u201d Under the thunder.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Destroyer :: Destroyer's Rubies Rubies is not always my favorite Destroyer record\u2014that, like favorite Dylan, changes with the day; there is too much brilliance across too many records to firmly settle on one eternal favorite. It is, however, the best Destroyer record: consistent, nuanced, equal parts enervating and energizing. The album sounds effortless, as if these songs were always there, hovering unseen, waiting to be plucked out of the air and given form by Bejar and his murderous band of Vancouverites. Even after twenty years, I would not change a second. This is as close to perfect as rock records get. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Oregon/Elvin Jones :: Together In 1976 the granola jazzists teamed up with one of the most titanic drummers in the sphere, Elvin Jones, for an album that could have marked a major departure for each party. Instead, the pairing allowed both to branch out and sample new realms while doing what they did best. Together , recorded in one day, may not be a flat-out masterpiece, but it does capture the unlikely convergence of two disparate scenes that turned out to have a surprising amount of common ground. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Muriel Grossmann :: Plays the Music of McCoy Tyner and the Grateful Dead Posted on February 3, 2026 February 3, 2026 On a four-track double album, Austrian saxophonist Muriel Grossmann pays tribute to the music of two American visionaries: McCoy Tyner and Bob Weir. Though the music of the jazz pianist and Grateful Dead guitarist would not seem to have much in common, Grossmann\u2019s festive, idiosyncratic renditions suggest some intriguing links. With an ear for robust melody and an open-ended approach, Grossmann has created a moving tribute that suggests the only true way to carry on is to transform. Have You Heard About the World Coming to an End? Posted on February 3, 2026 February 2, 2026 Released just before Christmas by London\u2019s Death is Not the End label, Have You Heard About the World Coming to an End? is a most welcome compilation of gospel choirs and harmony groups recorded between the late 1920s and mid 1950s. It\u2019s marvelous stuff\u2014raw and scruffy and spirited and cool. The Clean :: Mister Pop Posted on February 2, 2026 February 2, 2026 While consistency was always a calling card for legendary New Zealand band The Clean, their final record Mister Pop deserves a spot in the pantheon of all-time excellent swan song records. While never feeling a departure from the band\u2019s signature guitar pop sound, the record plays out like a swirling homage to the titan influences of the past: from the pure jangly nod to Rubber Soul and Ray Davies playbook to Velvets guitar drones and a pure krautrock experiment. On the eve of a recently announced definitive book on the band and following the tragic passing of the late Hamish Kilgour, the now seventeen-year old record provides a deeply fascinating revisit. Adam Bhala Lough on Deepfaking Sam Altman Posted on February 2, 2026 February 2, 2026 Adam Bhala Lough has made films about capricious characters. See his 2008 film The Upsetter: The Life & Music of \u201cLee\u201d Scratch Perry , or his 2009 film about Lil Wayne, The Carter , or his 2023 HBO series Telemarketers , about the underbelly of the telemarketing industry. But his new film, Deepfaking Sam Altman , is his most experimental and unusual project yet. Aquarium Drunkard caught up with Bhala Lough to discuss the movie, AI\u2019s potential and drawbacks, and why at the end of the day, we replace our humanity with efficient machinery at our own peril. Big Sky Documentary Film Festival 2026 Posted on January 29, 2026 January 29, 2026 We are heading to Missoula, MT next month. Excited to announce\u00a0that Aquarium Drunkard has curated the music portion of the 2026 Big Sky Documentary Film Festival happening\u00a0between February 13-22.\u00a0Seven music docs, new and vintage. Justin will be on site first weekend. Featuring:\u00a0Sun Ra: Do the Impossible.\u00a0Speed Racer: Welcome to the World of Vic Chesnutt. Little Feat: The\u00a0Documentary. Summer Tour. Chet Baker: Let\u2019s Get Lost. Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together. Benjamin Smoke. Donald Byrd :: Ethiopian Knights Posted on January 29, 2026 January 27, 2026 After a decade under Van Gelder\u2019s roof, Donald Byrd decamps for sun-kissed LA to record Ethiopian Knights , an album that rests comfortably in the improvisational sweet spot where Mwandishi and Peter Green\u2019s End of the Game converge; acknowledging the gravitational pull of early 70s jazz funk but reveling in the turf that lies at its edge. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on January 28, 2026 January 27, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Fabiano Do Nascimento & Vittor Santos Orchestra :: Vila Posted on January 28, 2026 January 27, 2026 Vila , the new symphonic samba jazz album by prolific Brazilian guitarist Fabiano do Nascimento, feels like both his most intimate and his most grandiose, as he tries to keep the idyllic minimalism of his style of acoustic guitar while striving for the expressive radiance of 1960s noir film scores. Nascimento, now a fixture of the Los Angeles jazz scene, wanted the record to pay tribute to the street he grew up in Rio, an enclosed alleyway in the old neighborhood of Catete . . Gary Peacock/Ralph Towner :: Oracle Posted on January 27, 2026 January 25, 2026 The recently reissued Oracle , a collaboration between bassist Gary Peacock and recently deceased guitarist Ralph Towner gives us a look at two legends in deep midcareer. Originally released in 1995, it shows two restless musicians, each with their own highly developed, distinct musical language, looking to mix things up. Though more Peacock-forward, its seamless mix of carefully spontaneous playing and freewheeling composition serves as a fitting farewell to Towner, and reminds us that the great ones never stop evolving, long after their so-called \u201cclassic\u201d eras have ended. The Disassociation :: Losing Is A Luxury Posted on January 27, 2026 January 25, 2026 From the mysterious expanses of southern California\u2019s Inland Empire emerges \u2026 The Disassociation! This new group is a powerful joining of forces, an impressive melding of minds, bringing together long-running lo-fi indie pioneers Refrigerator (a band that today continues to be underrated, even by the cognoscenti), Amy Maloof of Falcon Eddy, artist/musician/DJ Sam Sousa, and the brilliant author Jonathan Lethem. Winged Wheel :: Desert So Green Posted on January 26, 2026 January 25, 2026 Winged Wheel\u2019s third LP, Desert So Green , shows off this imaginative and evolving approach with terrific results. Though certain elements remain in place, the dream team sextet (Whitney Johnson, Cory Plump, Matthew J. Rolin, Steve Shelley, Lonnie Slack and Fred Thomas) seem intent on not making the same record twice. Pullman :: III Posted on January 26, 2026 January 24, 2026 This third album from the ambient folk-blues supergroup Pullman explores the connection between memory and physical frailty, finding musical communion amid loss. It\u2019s a quiet, emotionally charged gift, letting long-time member and early onset Alzheimers sufferer Tim Barnes make the most of his limited remaining time on earth. The Lagniappe Sessions :: The Slaps Posted on January 23, 2026 January 22, 2026 Via Chicago, guitarist Rand Kelly, bassist Ramsey Bell, and drummer Josh Resing are The Slaps. Formed in 2017, the genre agnostic trio are constantly in motion, and, more impressively, consistently interesting. This installment of the Lagniappe Sessions finds the band paying tribute to pre- Dark Side era Floyd with a lived-in, and woolly, cover of Obscured by Clouds\u2019 \u201cWot\u2019s\u2026 Uh the Deal\u201d. AD Manna, indeed! And keeping things local, they deliver an amped up version of friend and touring partner hemlock\u2019s \u201cUnder All The Kudzu\u201d \u2026 Load More The AD Interview Lagniappe Sessions Transmissions Podcast Mixtapes Email Newsletter AD Supply Membership Search for: The AD Interview Lagniappe Sessions Transmissions Podcast Mixtapes Email Newsletter AD Supply Membership Twitter Instagram Facebook Threads Bluesky Aquarium Drunkard Membership Membership About Contact Supply Back to Top"

But the band\u2019s solo creator, Ryan Koepke from British Columbia, Canada, has an explanation: The name \u201c Cepheidae Variable \u201d is a bit of nonsense. I wanted to name the project \u201cCepheid Variable\u201d; however, I quickly realized every word and combination of words under the sun has been used at this point. So it became a play on words, and now it\u2019s about a family of jellyfish. Nonsense it may be, but the story brings a smile \u2014 and so does Cepheidae Variable\u2019s music, though it\u2019s far away from nonsense. As captured on the project\u2019s debut album Primordial Reverie (released last November), it\u2019s a head-spinning but carefully plotted amalgamation of varied inspirations and stylistic ingredients. Ryan\u2019s identification of bands whose music has heavily influenced him gives some sense of that: Dream Theater , Haken , Intervals , Wintersun , and Caligula\u2019s Horse . The album is itself carefully plotted and tells a story, even though it doesn\u2019t include vocals. As he has explained: Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 9:57 am Tagged with: Cepheidae Variable AN NCS PREMIERE:  DISGUSTINGEST \u2014 \u201cDIGITAL CYST\u201d Album Reviews , Premieres , SHORT BUT SWEET No Responses \u00bb Feb 03 2026 (written by Islander) Look around and you can find forms of entertainment (as well as real-world events) that are disgusting . Keep looking and you can find things that are more disgusting . And then there is Disgustingest . Dictionaries and grammarians would frown on that word, but as metal band-names go, it works a lot better than MOST DISGUSTING . But what were these Coloradans thinking when they picked that name? After all, the history of death metal is filled with big rotting piles of maggot-ridden, stomach-churning musical foulness. It\u2019s a high bar to surmount (or if you prefer, a really low one to crawl under) to hold yourself out as Disgustingest . But these people do their damnedest to live up to the challenge, as you\u2019re about to find out. Today we\u2019re helping announce that on February 20th Paper Wings Records will release Disgustingest\u2019s second EP, aptly named Coagulating Putrescence , and we\u2019re also premiering its first single, \u201c Digital Cyst \u201c. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 8:55 am Tagged with: Disgustingest OUR LIST OF 2025\u2019S MOST INFECTIOUS EXTREME METAL SONGS: THE COMPLETE LIST MOST INFECTIOUS SONGS-2025 3 Responses \u00bb Feb 03 2026 (written by Islander) Last Friday I posted the final installment in our list of 2025\u2019s Most Infectious Extreme Metal Songs , the one part of our year-end LISTMANIA series that I alone am responsible for. In compiling that list I wound up with 64 songs before forcing myself to stop. That compares to 69 songs on the 2024 list. As always, putting together the list was both fun and stressful \u2014 fun to re-listen to lots of good music and get reminded of what a good year it was for metal, stressful because list-making of any kind is so difficult for me. Also as usual, my list didn\u2019t cover the entire waterfront of metal genres, given the limitations of my own (still very expansive) tastes, And of course, as is true every year, I really wasn\u2019t finished when I stopped. A lot of candidates just as worthy as the 64 I chose were left by the wayside when I hit the February wall. Maybe some others will be honored by other writers (last year, for example, both DGR and Andy Synn added addenda to the list), but I don\u2019t know if or when that might happen this year, so I\u2019m doing this wrap-up post now. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 7:59 am THINGS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED (BUT SHOULDN\u2019T) Album Reviews No Responses \u00bb Feb 03 2026 ( Andy Synn selects six albums from last month that may have flown under your radar) January of 2026 was a very busy month\u2026 not just in terms of the number of albums being released but on a personal level as well (did I mention I\u2019ve got a brand new song out this Friday from my own band, being released as part of a massive charity compilation?). As a result it feels like I missed out on covering more releases than usual last month, meaning that this is going to be the first of two separate \u201cThings You May Have Missed\u201d columns this week, as there\u2019s simply too many albums (and I still won\u2019t be covering everything I\u2019d have liked to) requiring your (and my) attention to fit into just one article.

Be the change you want to see in the world. I want to hear more of doom\u2019s despair injected into black metal, so I am going to write about blackened doom. In particular, the band Worm . Two songs into the new album Necropalace and it\u2019s clear that they have grown as songwriters. Refining what they do with a larger-than-life dynamic range to the dramatic swells of guitars, it pretty much sounds the way the album cover looks, music for vampires ruling a cosmic portal in Dungeons and Dragons .

The first few reviews of every year lately have felt like an exercise in madness, an attempt to conjure spirits out of thin air while dressed in the most ritualistic way possible. Me, seated with my skirt of bone and three-times-too-big mask in front of a fire and various runes and sigils that may or may not just be permutations on the Pepsi logo \u2013 we can\u2019t all be as creative as The Infernal Sea with their logo or draw inversions of an Asmodeus sigil ala Gaerea \u2013 and you wait for the year to speak to you. Last year\u2019s end-list was an exercise in scrying to see what the future holds and now we are waiting for the first spirit to reach across the void and grab us by the throat to compel us into 2026. So far, in spite of all the varied exhortations and exultations, that has no happened yet to this writer. 2026 remains frustratingly silent and has instead gifted us chances to catch up with late-2025 releases that were absorbed into year-end festivities alongside the initial wave of those brave enough to be the vanguard of a new year. It is the amorphous and fungible time that has us attempting to neatly can one horror only to open up the next can of worms to be unleashed. It\u2019s similar to how decades never end culturally right when a year turns over; it\u2019s more like there is a two-to-three year hangover period before one finally shuffles out the door and the next dumbass thing the kids repeat ad-nauseum can rule the roost. Eventually life becomes a series of checkpoints where you\u2019re counting decades by being thankful one particular bit of bullshit is done with and you don\u2019t have to hear about it anymore.

The broad focus is on his philosophy as a label curator and artist, but with a particular emphasis on the fascinating new album of his project Hyver .) Over the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been paying more and more attention to releases from the French label Antiq Records , run by L\u00e9on Guiselin . Antiq tends to release albums with a story behind it, and whenever I\u2019ve interviewed these bands, the lyrics have been wonderful! Stylistically, the label focuses on old-fashioned black metal with elements of folk and dungeon synth, which is unsurprising, as L\u00e9on himself plays in a number of projects and bands of this kind. One of his solo projects, Hyver , released a new full-length album Sha\u00e2tauno\u00e2r in November 2025, the structure of which resembles an old computer adventure game set in a medieval setting. You even have a choice of actions! But first of all, it\u2019s a proper black metal album with good dungeon synth layers! We did a pretty in-depth interview with L\u00e9on in the end of 2025 covering the themes of Sha\u00e2tauno\u00e2r , black metal in general, and Antiq itself. And I\u2019m pleased to share it with you.

Labels and bands seem to recognize that people aren\u2019t focusing as much as usual on new music, because they\u2019re diverted by things happening during the \u201choliday season\u201d and then by the turbulence of returning to work and school, and so the pace of new releases in the early part of January is slower than usual. But after a week or two, the dam bursts, and new stuff starts flooding out in a fury. At least that\u2019s how I see it from where I sit. I had SO MANY new songs and records I was interested in checking out for purposes of this column, too many for me to realistically investigate, especially since our terribly unreliable internet service has been down since mid-day on Saturday. My phone has worked reasonably well as a hot-spot for some things, like typing what you\u2019re reading now, but it doesn\u2019t provide a very good platform for streaming music. The result is that I defaulted to music I had already acquired for myself before our net service collapsed. Which is not a bad way to proceed, because there\u2019s a reason why I had acquired all this music for myself \u2014 it\u2019s all very good! Each selection is also very different from the other two.

For one thing, they\u2019re mostly known by the shortened version, Eximperitus , anyway. And, for another\u2026 c\u2019mon people, there\u2019s only so many hours in the day/days in the week/weeks in the month, and by the time I\u2019d have finished typing it for the third or fourth time it would probably be mid-March. Suffice it to say, however, that this band\u2026 by any other name\u2026 would still be as brutal, as technical, and as mind-bending, and more than capable of goig toe-to-toe with the likes of Origin or Wormed , Wormhole or Defeated Sanity , or absolutely any of the very best of the Brutal/Technical Death Metal scene.

Sometimes many of them are deflating, and the hunt goes on. Sometimes a lot of them are great, and the choices become difficult. But this week I happened upon seven songs in a row and knew right away that six of those would be here today. (I left one of them aside, so the usual collage of cover images would be symmetrical.) As it also happened, the following songs include an unusual amount of singing \u2014 not singing we have to just put up with because other aspects of the songs make them commanding, but because the singing is itself a big part of the draw. And as it happened, all but one of the songs debuted with good videos. None of these bands is even close to the Metallica strata of stardom, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that most of them are well-known among metal lovers, or at least the kind of metal lovers who show up at our doorstep. Most of these bands have had careers of significant length and discographies that are well-respected. For these columns, I usually try to work in music by bands from deeper under the ground, using bigger names as lures for visitors who might not know of the more obscure names. But I didn\u2019t have room to do as much of that today as I typically do. My goal is to make amends tomorrow.
