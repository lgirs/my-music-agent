Filed Under: Interviews , Outlaw Country , Why It Matters Tagged With: Lightning Stills Monday Morning Video \u2013 Matt Charette Monday, February 16, 2026 By Mayer Danzig Early last week, Boston singer-songwriter Matt Charette showed up at his barbershop to find it underwater. Literally. An upstairs neighbor didn\u2019t take proper cold weather precautions, a pipe burst, and water came pouring down into the shop. The damage was devastating. But Charette\u2019s doing what DIY musicians do\u2014skip the pity party, roll up the sleeves, [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Rock , Videos Tagged With: Matt Charette Now & Then: Melissa Carper & Theo Lawrence\u2019s\u00a0Havin\u2019 A Talk\u00a0and the reach of\u00a0Time (The Revelator) Sunday, February 15, 2026 By Tom Osborne Duets are relationship counseling with better suits. Two people, one microphone, and a shared agreement to tell the truth in public as long as it rhymes. Melissa Carper and Theo Lawrence understand the assignment. Their debut duo album\u00a0Havin\u2019 A Talk\u00a0leans into the oldest trick in country music: make the song a conversation, then let the conversation become the plot.

Filed Under: Readers' Pick Tagged With: Melissa Carper , Theo Lawrence The Sky Chiefs \u2013 The Sky Chiefs Thursday, February 12, 2026 By Shawn Underwood You\u2019ve no doubt heard about artists, or their families, who\u2019ve found a trove of lost recordings buried in the back of a closet in some nearly forgotten studio. Springsteen and Jennings come immediately to mind. Typically these are extra tunes that get cut from a record or demos that never really found a home and [\u2026] Filed Under: Alt-Country , Americana , Bluegrass , Country , Reviews Tagged With: The Sky Chiefs Clay Street Unit \u2013 Sin & Squalor Thursday, February 12, 2026 By Shawn Underwood I have no doubt the first secular song ever written was a love ballad. I\u2019m equally certain the second tune was about being away from home and longing to return. Denver\u2019s Clay Street Unit just released their debut full length album, and while they don\u2019t call that out as any kind of unifying theme, a [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Bluegrass , Country Tagged With: Clay Street Unit Listening for the Vanishing Words: James McMurtry at Full Measure Wednesday, February 11, 2026 By Brian D'Ambrosio James McMurtry does not talk much, and he does not volunteer myth. He answers questions carefully, sometimes obliquely, often economically, as if every word costs something. That reserve has become part of his public character, as recognizable as the stark clarity of his songs. McMurtry is a listener first, a keen observer of language and [\u2026] Filed Under: Americana , Interviews , Singer/Songwriter Tagged With: James McMurtry Patton Magee of The Nude Party on How They Got a Sitar and the Best Kept Secret in Music Tuesday, February 10, 2026 By Mayer Danzig Patton Magee of The Nude Party talks about the benefit of staying busy and recalls what happened when the police showed up at the band\u2019s first gig. Filed Under: Interviews , Rock , Why It Matters Tagged With: Patton Magee , The Nude Party Monday Morning Video \u2013 Tyler-James Kelly Monday, February 09, 2026 By Mayer Danzig The beauty of true country music is its simplicity. But there\u2019s real complexity in creating something that feels effortless\u2014distilling a song idea down to its core, making it lyrically accessible, and setting it to a melody that\u2019s both immediate and unforgettable. Tyler-James Kelly did exactly that on his solo debut, and he continues that success [\u2026] Filed Under: Acoustic , Country , Videos Tagged With: Tyler-James Kelly Now & Then: Natalie Del Carmen\u2019s\u00a0Pastures\u00a0and the reach of\u00a0Our Endless Numbered Days Sunday, February 08, 2026 By Tom Osborne Los Angeles is not exactly famous for quiet. It\u2019s famous for traffic that hums in B-flat and palm trees that look like they\u2019re always posing for a headshot. So when a 24-year-old songwriter from L.A. drops an Americana record called\u00a0Pastures, the first surprise is the title. The second surprise is that it actually sounds like one: open air, creaky wood, and time moving at a human speed.

He does use his voice like an acrobat, though, sometimes crooning sweetly, other times screaming like a demon. - Tim Sendra Editorial Picks for Vertical layout, Week 1 New Music Friday New Releases This Week In Memoriam Chuck Negron, 1942-2026 Interviews They Shot the Piano Player: An Interview with Filmmaker Fernando Trueba Our Properties AllMusic AllMovie SideReel Site Overview New Releases Discover Articles Recommendations About What is AllMusic?

Generic selectors Exact matches only Search in title Search in content Post Type Selectors Latest Reviews All 37476 Reviews The All Seeing Eye Pollard Row Overall, this was an excellent album. At times, it was shrouded in mystery, while at others, the music was right in your face. Even in the latter times, the music has a darkness to it that is hard to describe, but it attracted me like a moth to flame. Wings of the Nightstorm (Reissue) Thus Defiled Whereas the musical style definitely is Black Metal, THUS DEFILED aren\u2019t afraid to venture out into Thrash and/or Heavy metal territory when the songs demand it. That is where the real power lies within THUS DEFILED. Keep The Fire Burning Sacred Leather SACRED LEATHER hail from Indianapolis, which lies in the USA state of Indiana. According to the Metal Archives they play Heavy/Thrash Metal, but I would rather refer to their music genre as being a mix of NWOBHM, Old School Heavy Metal and Eighties Speed Metal. The Lionspirit Imperatore The sound that \u201cThe Lionspirit\u201d is showing off is superb, is exactly what this kind of music needs. The bombastic and epic parts are being blasted through your speakers, which does happen all through the album. Terra Black Magic Tree BLACK MAGIC TREE has the capability to write songs that come from listening to a lot of different bands that have coloured the Rock scene throughout the decades, and they have made it into a beautiful melting pot on \u201cTerra\u201d. Bloody Circuits Creaturelens This album was excellent, and I wish they had a social media account. The synthwave was smooth\u2026even cold at times, but always alive. For those of you who were alive in the 80\u2019s, this will be a sentimental sound. But like all good music, it lives today, not in the past. Shards of a Waking Sun Duchna As the album continued to move, I felt worse and worse, sort of like a cumulative effect of piling one burden on top of another, trying to break me. That\u2019s how powerful the emotional experience was. It\u2019s also an album buried in deep mystery, and if you take the plunge, you never know what you might unearth\u2026what secrets might be revealed. Reden\u00e7\u00e3o Pelas Chamas Reden\u00e7\u00e3o Pelas Chamas I never knew how great black metal in Portuguese sounded up until today. Pestmond Siechknecht Siechknecht\u2019s \u201cPestmond\u201d is one of those albums that make you glad to be alive. It\u2019s tough and bold and it\u2019s also melodic and inspiring. Lidande T\u00e5rf\u00f6dd If the digital only release of T\u00c5RF\u00d6DD\u2019s \u201cLidande\u201d left you a bit peckish, you can now snag its physical cousin via Purity Through Fire. Existence No Terror In The Bang This is an album that\u2019s a study in extremes. On one end, it\u2019s smooth, melodic, and perhaps even introspective at times. On the other end however, it\u2019s aggressive, brutal, even punishing, I feel like five songs was enough to capture the band\u2019s essence, primarily because each of them had a similar sound and a similar length. One thing I would have liked would be a bit more diversity, but I am looking forward to what they might do next. Forged In Hatred Deathraiser \u201cForged In Hatred\u201d celebrates classical Thrash Metal with plenty of late 80s vibes, pace, aggression, dark melodies, and cool solos. It is a 35 minutes of pure mayhem and destruction Krushers Of The World Kreator KREATOR deliver a signature album with a unique KREATOR sound. \u201cKrushers Of The World\u201d is a well-composed mixture of fast classical Thrash and melodic mid-tempo tracks, all embedded into a dark and at times melancholic melodic framework Severed Heart City Greywind Greywind are a brother and sister duo from Killarney, Ireland.They are an Emo duo who [\u2026] Stages to Osiris (Rebirth) Divided By Design I love instrumental Metal, let me just get that out of the way. The album showed promise at times, and their musicianship was strong, but there were also some phasing issues here and there. The album as a whole also suffered from a lack of direction. Evolution Dark Heart Dark Heart were formed during the early eighties, releasing the debut album \u2018\u2019Shadows of the [\u2026] Cairn Parallel Minds This album was lengthy and the 60+ minutes of run time did seem to have some concept qualities. Their musicianship was excellent, but I found it difficult to really be able to dig into their sound. Normally, I love mashups\u2026this one just didn\u2019t do much for me and just wasn\u2019t overly memorable.

The concept behind their debut album, \u201cCzarty Polskie,\u201d has been controversial not only for the AI debate but for the many references to Polish demonology. On All Hallows Eve, Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with members of CZART to discuss everything from AI to the reasons why metal resonates so much in Poland to whether we are living in the best of times or the worst. Most importantly, they discuss the beloved CZART goat. Sam Graff Agenbite Misery AGENBITE MISERY hails from New Hampshire. In February 2026, the band will be releasing their debut album, \"Remorse of Conscience.\" The album is an experimental metal interpretation of \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce. This month Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, was able to catch up with Sam Graff (guitars, vocals, synth) to discuss the some deeper details about the band, their aspirations, and their upcoming album as well as the curious link between literature and metal. Stefano Fiorelli Warcoe WARCOE hails from Pesaro, Italy. Formed in 2021, following the year of our plague, the Doom trio has been blazing a trail through the Italian Doom scene with one monumental album after the other. On September 26, 2025 they released their third full-length album, \u201cUpon Tall Thrones,\u201d which not only weighed in at 8/10 on the Metal Temple scales but hit #1 on Doom Charts for September 2025. This month Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, was able to catch up with Stefano Fiorelli (guitars, vocals) to discuss the origin story of WARCOE, details of their latest album, and even speculate on the impacts of AI and streaming platforms. Jacob Curwen All Hell All Hell has been described as a Blackened Thrash band, but they are much more. On October 10, 2025, the trio for Ashville, North Carolina release their fifth full-length album, \"Sunsetter,\" via Terminus Hate City. Gary Hernandez, writer and editor for Metal Temple, caught up with Jacob Curwen (vocals, guitars) to discuss topics ranging from the band's origins to the details of \"Sunsetter\" to AI in metal.

The series drops comics into the deep end of a mystery meet-and-greet, literally blindfolding them until they're seated right in front of their fellow guest comedian and are forced to answer our ridiculous questions! In Defense of Ska Hosts Aaron Carnes (author of \"In Defense of Ska\") and Adam Davis (Link 80, Omingone) chat with people in and outside of the ska scene to tell its stories, show its pervasiveness in culture, and defend it to their last dying breath.

The phrase \u2018Polish death metal\u2019 always grabs my attention, whether it\u2019s technical like early Decapitated , thrashy \u00c3\u00a0 la Vader , or as blackened as Behemoth . Such was the case when I espied Shine \u2019s Wrathcult lying unclaimed in the promo bin.\u201d Hiding light under a cult bushel. Phasma \u2013 Purgatory Review By Kenstrosity on February 17, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Metal , Deathcore , Hardcore , Technical Death Metal , 21 comments \u201cSometimes an album comes around ye olde promo pit that looks and smells familiar, but plays like something else entirely. Today\u2019s entry into the \u201cwhat the heck am I actually listening to?\u201d hall of infamy is Phasma \u2019s Purgatory . The third record from the Greek/US duo, and the first carried by a label\u00e2\u0080\u0094our beloved Transcending Obscurity Records\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Purgatory continually subverted every expectation I had. In doing so, it became one of my biggest pleasant surprises in recent memory.\u201d Set Phasmas to brutal stun. Cattle Hammer \u2013 Dark Thoughts with Lights Out By Spicie Forrest on February 17, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Doom Metal , Drone , Sludge , 25 comments \u201cBased in Birmingham, UK, Cattle Hammer was formed by vocalist/guitarist Duncan Wilkins in 2023. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joined by I Cartwright on drums, J Wyles on guitar, and D Von Donovan on bass. Together, they mix a caustic brew of drone, doom, and sludge, but each track on Dark Thoughts with Lights Out has its own identity.\u201d Hammers for beef. Worm \u2013 Necropalace Review By Thus Spoke on February 16, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , Death Doom , Death Metal , Dungeon Synth , 109 comments \u201c Worm s are rich fodder for metal band names, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. They\u2019re gross, alienlike, and carry connotations of death and decay; and that\u2019s before you start spelling it with a \u2018v\u2019 and thereby reference dragons, sea monsters, and the Devil himself. While sharing the collective imagination, this Worm definitely distinguishes themselves. After a shaky start, it was Foreverglade that first saw Worm realize their potential with a lean towards doom-death that retained just enough synth-forward black metal and balanced a murky soundscape with syrupy sweet guitar solos.\u201d Worm turning? Velothian \u2013 Mythic Dawn Review By Mystikus Hugebeard on February 16, 2026 in Reviews , Atmospheric Black Metal , Black Metal , Folk Metal , 29 comments \u201cIf, like me, you played a lot of the original Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), then you might agree that the game has a nigh unbeatable vibe. The densely forested hills rolling into the distance, the subtle call of a nearby Nirnroot, the grossly overconfident mudcrabs, the endearing jank of two townspeople conversing like they\u2019ve only just discovered human language; it\u2019s a distinctly cozy high fantasy setting that feels like home in a way few modern games could hope to replicate. Thus, I was excited to learn that Velothian , the epic post-black metal act that was previously featured on the 2024 EP Roundup for their Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind -themed EP Path of the Incarnate , now draws from Oblivion as inspiration for their debut full-length, Mythic Dawn .\u201d Scroll goals. Yer Metal Is Olde: DragonForce \u2013 Inhuman Rampage By Baguette of Bodom on February 15, 2026 in Yer Metal Is Olde , Power Metal , 65 comments \u201cWait, the funny Guitar Hero III song is turning 20? What the fuck? Yes, indeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094what better way to kick off 2026 than to make the masses feel Olde? < DragonForce needs little introduction to anyone who existed during the \u201900s. Born from the remnants of black metal band Demoniac in 1999, British guitarists Herman Li and Sam Totman have always been the tandem at the center of the band with their Yngwie-esque \u201cmore is more\u201d philosophy. Valley of the Damned and Sonic Firestorm already got significant attention, but 2006\u2019s Inhuman Rampage is the one that made the band infamous.\u201d DraGONES! Gorrch \u2013 Stillamentum Review By Spicie Forrest on February 14, 2026 in Reviews , Black Metal , 18 comments \u201cFounded in 2010 and hailing from Cavaso del Tomba in northeastern Italy, Gorrch is the unsettling black metal project of fraternal duo, Chrimsicrin and Droich. Now, a decade after 2015 debut Nera estasi , Gorrch plumbs the depths of the abyss, seeking to give voice to the primal fear and disgust of being covered in roiling, writhing masses of maggots.\u201d It\u2019s NOT a gorrch! Teutonic Slaughter \u2013 Cheap Food Review By Andy-War-Hall on February 13, 2026 in Reviews , Thrash Metal , 10 comments \u201cBecoming a fully-fledged metalhead is when you stop associating German metal with Rammstein and start with Teutonic thrash. There\u2019s something about Germany that just makes thrash metal meaner, dirtier, and nastier than anywhere else, and without Teutonic thrash, extreme metal would likely look very different from where it is today. Knowing and loving this heritage, Germany\u2019s own Teutonic Slaughter throws their feather-capped hat into the ring with their third album, Cheap Food , brandishing both a ridiculous album cover and a conviction to maintain the glory of old school Teutonic thrash metal.\u201d Eat, prey, leave. Scythe \u2013 Boiled Alive Review By Grin Reaper on February 13, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , 55 comments \u201cIn the midst of a recent metal deep-dive, Romania\u2019s Scythe skulked out from a Bandcamp back alley and bludgeoned me with the flat side of their blade, knocking me senseless with scuzzy shenanigans. We weren\u2019t graced with a promo for Scythe \u2019s self-released debut, but Boiled Alive packs in so much grimy panache that after my first listen, I had it shortlisted as someThing You Might Have Missed. Rather than wait several months before bringing attention to Boiled Alive , though, I volunteered to burn some midnight oil and write about this quartet from Constan\u00c8\u009ba.\u201d Get in the pot! Slaughterday \u2013 Dread Emperor Review By Tyme on February 13, 2026 in Reviews , Death Metal , Doom Metal , 25 comments \u201cLongtime readers of AMG may remember the last time German OSDM stalwarts Slaughterday graced these digital pages. It was long enough ago that EPs were still getting the full-on review treatment, which enabled Slaughterday \u2019s second release, Ravenous , to land a respectable 3.0/5.0 rating. What I was surprised to discover was the lack of any additional coverage, despite Slaughterday dropping three subsequent long players since then. Whether this fact boils down to a lack of promo or a lack of interest is irrelevant, considering I was able to wrestle Slaughterday \u2019s newest offering of odorous offal, Dread Emperor , from the murkiest depths of the sump.\u201d T.G.I.S.

Lightning-fast, barely coherent at times; it feels like if it stopped at any given point, it\u2019d collapse, so barely is it being held together.

The immaculately layered album balances echoing, frenzied instrumental tracks with vocal tracks featuring cameos by Barbadian reggae mastro Dennis Bovell (on the serene, spiritual offering \u201cCanaan Land\u201d) and Welsh musician Carwyn Ellis. There\u2019s a worldbuilding element to the references, and an enigmatic quality to the righteous mishmash of a musical palette, one best enjoyed floating along and wrapped up in that mystery. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Wet Tuna :: Vast The musical and psychic evolution of Matt \u201cMV\u201d Valentine traces a wide-ranging and gloriously unwieldy trajectory through sound and space for those intrepid enough to follow it. Spanning the earliest days of Tower Recordings, a bevy of solo albums, one of the most exhaustive and rewarding live recording archives you can dig into, and twenty-five years copiloting the fantastic voyage of MV&EE, Valentine has never stopped pushing the music outward and onward. And it doesn\u2019t get any farther out than the freewheeling funkified flights of Wet Tuna. Read More Spotify Apple Music Close La Ola Interior :: Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 Strange, hypnotic signals call out like the gleam from a lighthouse on this collection of postmodern celestial hymns. Finis Africae\u2019s \u201cHybla\u201d is a smoky tribal chant of minimalist, earthy experimentation, while Miguel A. Ruiz\u2019s \u201cTrivandrum\u201d gives way to a submerged industrial trance with a warbling, underlying sense of foreboding. Another key artist on the comp, V\u00edctor Nubla, presents haunted waltzes\u2014something like baroque chamber pieces sprinkled with subterranean fairy dust. Read More Close Kelan Phil Cohran & Legacy :: African Skies Recorded in 1993 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, African Skies received its first reissue earlier this year via the new Stones Throw imprint, Listening Position. On commission for Adler, the seven tracks find Cohran decades removed from his seminal works with Sun Ra and The Artistic Heritage Ensemble, but very much in the pocket both tonally and spiritually. A \u201cmultisensory, Afrocentric journey into the starlit sky,\u201d the recordings originally served as the planetarium\u2019s score to sweeping panoramic footage of the cosmos as seen from various telescopes positioned throughout the African continent. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Shintaro Sakamoto :: Yoo-hoo In some ways, Shintaro Sakamoto\u2019s fifth record Yoo-hoo follows a continuation of the pop-centric sensibilities of Like A Fable : lifting backdrops of surf guitar, Spector-like orchestration and funky exotica crafted for the dancefloor in a way that only Sakamoto could usher into existence. Yet another work of an auteur of his musical craft, the album sees Sakamoto channel midcentury Japanese styles like \u201cMood Kay\u014d\u201d, drawing from Latin rhythms and Hawaiin compositions. As has become customary, the musician is able to masterfully curate shadowy corners of the past to create something exceptionally neoteric. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close Fripp & Eno :: Evening Star Fifty years on, you can hear large swaths of the ambient genre echoing through Evening Star : The cosmic calm of Steve Roach\u2019s classic 1988 album Structures From Silence . The neo-classical predilections of Eluvium and Stars of the Lid. The billowing atmosphere of Wolfgang Voigt\u2019s music under the name Gas. The dreamstate travels of Windy & Carl. And so on and so on. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Close The Ibrahim Khalil Shihab Quintet :: Spring Recorded in the late 1960s by Cape Town pianist Ibrahim Khalil Shihab and his group, Spring calls to mind Atlantic-era Coltrane at its breeziest, with saxophonist Winston \u2018Mankunku\u2019 Ngozi fluttering above the steady, sunny backing. Though it has to be said that this collection of musicians could get heavy if need be; check out the masterfully moody vibe they bring to \u201cBirds,\u201d a ten-minute homage to Trane\u2019s \u201cSpiritual.\u201d Read More Close Ryo Fukui :: Mellow Dream Never garnering quite the level of attention of Fukui\u2019s debut masterpiece Scenery, 1977\u2019s smooth Mellow Dream is just that: another soulful, excellent record by the Japanese jazz innovator. Amidst pieces inspired by earlier jazz pianist greats like Bill Evans and Barry Harris, the major highlight \u201cBaron Potato Blues\u201d is an epic piece crafted in the Coltrane/Tyner mold. Read More Spotify Apple Music Tidal Bill Fay :: From The Bottom Of An Old Grandfather Clock (A Collection Of Demos And Outtakes 1966-1970) Posted on February 17, 2026 February 17, 2026 Out of the mist! If you blinked, you might have missed it. Dead Oceans quietly re-released From the Bottom of an Old Grandfather Clock last December\u2014a twenty-five-track journey through Bill Fay\u2019s back pages, loaded with demos and long-forgotten outtakes. Having largely disappeared from public life after the release of 1971\u2019s Time of the Last Persecution , only to reemerge in a quietly triumphant late-career renaissance in 2012, the collection stands as a worthy and necessary addition to the English singer-songwriter and pianist\u2019s enduring oeuvre. Stephen McCraven :: Wooley The Newt Posted on February 17, 2026 February 16, 2026 Originally released on Marion Brown\u2019s Sweet Earth imprint in 1979, Wooley The Newt is a true lost spiritual jazz relic from percussionist and composer Stephen McCraven. Resurrected in a limited capacity by British reissue label Moved-By-Sound at the tail end of last year, the record was sampled by Stephen\u2019s son Makaya on his 2020\u2019s reimaging of Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s I\u2019m New Here . Recorded in Paris and more than long overdue, it\u2019s a fascinating relic of seventies avant-jazz and a lost bandleader debut of the utmost artistic craft. Lala Lala :: Heaven 2 Posted on February 17, 2026 February 16, 2026 Heaven 2 is a road album of sorts, where the Chicago songwriter breaks out for fresh territories. Whether toward or away from something is anybody\u2019s guess. What keeps things real, what keeps them compelling, is the cigarette-ash astringency of LaLa LaLa\u2019s central melodies.\u00a0No matter how far she drives from the big city, her songs will, perhaps, always have a tough urban grit to them. John Renbourn :: Live In Kyoto 1978 Posted on February 16, 2026 February 16, 2026 Recorded during the second of two nights John Renbourn played at Kyoto\u2019s Jittoku Coffeehouse, Live in Kyoto 1978 captures the guitarist in a moment of intimacy and precision. Poised and unhurried, the set finds Renbourn relaxed, patiently threading his repertoire before a hushed, attentive room. A baker\u2019s dozen, these recordings were captured on site by audio archivist Satoro Fujii and unearthed forty years later in 2018 via Drag City. Tucker Zimmerman: In Memoriam (1941-2026) Posted on February 16, 2026 February 15, 2026 On January 17, 2026, the world lost the great Tucker Zimmerman and his wife of more than fifty years, Marie-Claire, to a house fire in Liege, Belgium. He was 84 years old. Though born in the United States, he had been a resident of Europe since 1966. A novelist, poet, folk singer, classical composer, & electronic musician, Zimmerman had a deep and restless career with more than a dozen albums to his name. However, because of his status as an expat, he was largely overlooked in his birth country for most of his lifetime. Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard :: February 2026 Posted on February 15, 2026 February 11, 2026 Freeform transmissions from Radio Free Aquarium Drunkard on dublab. Airing every third Sunday of the month, RFAD on dublab features the pairing of Tyler Wilcox\u2019s Doom and Gloom from the Tomb and Chad DePasquale\u2019s New Happy Gathering. This month, Tyler kicks it off with a mix of recent instrumental favorites, and Chad follows it up with a Valentine\u2019s mix \u2014 broken, belated, and bewildered!\u00a0Sunday, 4-6pm PT. The Elegance of Longing: Prefab Sprout\u2019s Steve McQueen and Jordan: The Comeback Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 There are albums that shimmer with impossible ambition, records that sound like they were beamed in from some parallel dimension where pop music never surrendered its claim to sophistication. In the mid-to-late 1980s, while synthesizers ruled the airwaves and production grew increasingly bombastic, Paddy McAloon was writing songs of such disarming tenderness and linguistic agility that they seemed to exist outside time entirely. With Thomas Dolby\u2019s production expertise, Prefab Sprout created two albums \u2013 Steve McQueen in 1985 and Jordan: The Comeback in 1990 \u2013 that stand as monuments to what pop music can achieve when intelligence and emotion strike up a perfect balance. Tommy Hendrix :: Out Of The Mist (1958) Posted on February 13, 2026 February 12, 2026 Out Of The Mist (1958) is the lone trace of Tommy Hendrix, a cool-jazz crooner whose biography begins and ends with a solitary release. It\u2019s an obscure album lost to time by an artist who seemingly never existed. Tommy Hendrix is a midcentury ghost, and Out Of The Mist is the sound of his specter briefly passing through our dimension, like a puff of cigarette smoke lingering in a cocktail lounge that nobody has ever set foot in. Apparat :: A Hum of Maybe Posted on February 12, 2026 February 11, 2026 For the last two and a half decades, Apparat\u2019s Sascha Ring has been moving from austere, minimalist techno towards a lusher, though still beat-driven sound. A Hum of Maybe continues this trend, its pulse softened with pensive piano, trombone and fluttering voices. Momoko :: Momoko Gill Posted on February 12, 2026 February 11, 2026 \u201cNo Others\u201d lurches and glides, its stuttering rhythm anchored by acoustic bass and skittering snare, its vocal melody light and fluid.\u00a0The London-based Gill taps into bossa nova, tropicalia and fusion jazz on this and other tracks, blowing out phrases as iridescent as soap bubbles over hip-grinding, body-moving cadences.\u00a0This first single from the multi-instrumentalist and composer is layered but unencumbered. The Aquarium Drunkard Show: SIRIUS/XMU (7pm PST, Channel 35) Posted on February 11, 2026 February 10, 2026 Via satellite, transmitting from northeast Los Angeles \u2014 the Aquarium Drunkard Show on SIRIUS/XMU, channel 35. 7pm California time, Wednesdays. 34.1090\u00b0 N, 118.2334\u00b0 W Wet Tuna :: Vast Posted on February 11, 2026 February 10, 2026 The musical and psychic evolution of Matt \u201cMV\u201d Valentine traces a wide-ranging and gloriously unwieldy trajectory through sound and space for those intrepid enough to follow it. Spanning the earliest days of Tower Recordings, a bevy of solo albums, one of the most exhaustive and rewarding live recording archives you can dig into, and twenty-five years copiloting the fantastic voyage of MV&EE, Valentine has never stopped pushing the music outward and onward. And it doesn\u2019t get any farther out than the freewheeling funkified flights of Wet Tuna. The Beach Boys :: We Gotta Groove \u2013 The Brother Studio Years Posted on February 10, 2026 February 10, 2026 There is something undeniably miraculous about We Gotta Groove: The Brother Studio Years . Here, after nearly half a century, is not just a presentation of some of the strongest, strangest music Brian Wilson would ever record, but a celebration of it. In the late 1970s, many of these songs were dismissed out of hand as the work of a diminished artist, a man irrevocably changed by years of milkshakes and mental anguish. This reading was not entirely incorrect: the Brian of 1977 was indeed a different person. But as an artist, he was in full flower\u2014more truly himself than he ever had been, and perhaps ever would be.

They describe the band as \u201ca death grind assault unit blending the surgical brutality of death metal with the speed, chaos, and ferocity of grindcore\u201d. That description is true, but doesn\u2019t completely capture all the musical ingredients of Abyssurge . Most prominently, Strup\u2019s music is also hideously foul and abysmal as well as maniacally furious and brutally bludgeoning. But you\u2019ll soon see this for yourselves, because today we\u2019re premiering a full stream of this Kyiv band\u2019s debut \u2014 preceded (of course) by our own more detailed thoughts about what you\u2019re about to encounter.

When it comes to vicious hardcore punk, d-beat, and grind records, the label Iron Lung Records reigns supreme. However, it is rare that they release anything that falls more firmly in the metal camp. So when they do put something out that is unquestionably metal, it is something to take notice of. Such is the case with Black Phosphorous Dungeon , the new EP by Cryptid Spawn . When we say that Cryptid Spawn is undeniably metal, we aren\u2019t talking about Judas Priest , not that there would be anything wrong with that. Cryptid Spawn\u2019s leather-gloved hands are sticky with the DNA of the darkest extreme metal forebears. Think early Bathory , Blasphemy , Sarc\u00f3fago , and Hellhammer . \u201cGods of the Grim and Dismal World\u201d shows how they are able to blend the relentless blur of war metal with actual, discernible riffs, the song held together by a primitive but memorable chord progression. The vocals spew blasphemous phlegm in the best possible way, and when the guitars slow down partway through the song, the riff is the best combination of death metal crawl and sludge-ridden filth.It\u2019s an auspicious beginning to a short but devastating release. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 7:58 am Tagged with: Cryptid Spawn , Todd Manning SHORT BUT SWEET: GLASSBONE / KANONENFIEBER / MUDTOOTH SHORT BUT SWEET No Responses \u00bb Feb 17 2026 ( Andy Synn has three more bite-sized blasts of brutality to share with you today) As we all know, short-form releases (splits, EPs, and the like) tend to get the\u2026 ahem\u2026 short end of the stick when it comes to coverage (especially amongst the larger and/or more mainstream publications, who tend to prioritise full length albums, for obvious reasons). Last year, however, I managed to reverse this trend a little, covering more EPs than I did the year before that\u2026 and in 2026 I\u2019m hoping to continue expanding our coverage of releases best described as \u201cshort but sweet\u201d. Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Andy Synn at 6:58 am Tagged with: Andy Synn , Glassbone , Kanonenfieber , Mudtomb AN NCS PREMIERE:  MORS.VOID.DISCIPLINE \u2014 \u201cSANGUINEM IN ANUM CAPRAE PUTRESCENTIS EIACULANS\u201d Premieres 1 Response \u00bb Feb 16 2026 (written by Islander) Take it from someone who\u2019s been struggling to write about music for 16+ years: It\u2019s not easy to capture sounds in words, or to represent how they alter feelings and inspire the imagination without running afoul of triteness or tedium. A humbling challenge to be sure, but even more humbling when we run across the prose of the honcho behind Sentient Ruin Laboratories . Here, as a pertinent example, is an excerpt from the label\u2019s linguistic preview of an album that\u2019s the source of a song we\u2019re about to premiere: Chilean bestial goregrind terror-cult Mors.Void.Discipline emerge from the bottomless dungeons of South America\u2019s extreme metal underground with their debut full-length monstrosity Txketh)\u00ebk\u00e9 , a twenty-minute obfuscation of terror-spawning bestial war metal destruction swathed in the flesh-eating violence and maggot-infested putridity of 90\u2019s goregrind. Cryptic and malignant beyond thresholds comprehensible to man, Txketh)\u00ebk\u00e9 projects forth a cancerous aural perversion in which the war-mongering assaults of Blasphemy collide with early Carcass\u2019 mangled and deconstructed sonic butchery. Its astonishing hideousness and violence are not only shaped by its unequivocal descendancy, but further complexed by the peculiar antediluvian and occult aura historically permeating Chile\u2019s underground scene, as well as by the band\u2019s enigmatic inner workings and imagination harvesting perversions from beyond the reach of sanity. You see? Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 9:00 am Tagged with: Mors.Void.Discipline AN NCS PREMIERE:  OSMIUM GATE \u2014 \u201cWATERS OF NATRON\u201d Premieres No Responses \u00bb Feb 16 2026 (written by Islander) We are genuinely thrilled today to introduce you to Osmium Gate , a two-person instrumental metal band \u201cforged in the shadows of Salt Lake City, Utah\u201d. Those two people are guitarist/bassist Drew Ehrgott , known for his work in Reverence Of The Martyr , and drummer Rene Gomez , \u201cwhose percussive presence reverberates through Ibex Throne , Yaotl Mictlan , and his bass work in Pan-Amerikan Native Front .\u201d Osmium Gate was formed in December 2024, and they now have a debut album named Cannibal Galaxy set for release on March 13th . We\u2019ll share these further words from the press materials we\u2019ve received, already excerpted above: Continue reading \u00bb Posted by Islander at 7:59 am Tagged with: Osmium Gate CONVERGE:  \u201cLOVE IS NOT ENOUGH\u201d Album Reviews No Responses \u00bb Feb 16 2026 (Last Friday Converge released their new album Love Is Not Enough , and below you\u2019ll find Wil Cifer\u2019s thoughts about it.) It is always an exercise in objectivity when you are reviewing one of your favorite bands. For me, they are under more scrutiny as they set my expectations high, leaving me with certain boxes to check off as I am listening. The larger their catalog, the more expectations their legacy has built. I am not surprised that the hyper-aggression of Boston hardcore legends Converge has endured, now 11 albums into their career. Their new album does find it being refined and often being more of an Entombed -like stomp. There are some thoughts on the idea that seem to be stuck on the chaos of what they do, but in truth, compared to albums like When Forever Comes Crashing , it is a much more streamlined effort that is more accessible to a larger metal audience.

In yesterday\u2019s roundup I mentioned that I had a cold. I took some over-the-counter stuff last night to help me sleep through it. I woke up 10 hours later, so I guess it worked, and hence the late start. I picked all of today\u2019s recommendations yesterday, and though my head is infected, these songs proved to be both more viral and more virile than the rhinovirus. I\u2019m very happy with the choices and hope you will be too. By way of preview, things begin in what we might call avant-garde territory, and then move in more punk-influenced directions, and then you\u2019ll get blistered and beaten. At the end is an album that\u2019s outside the usual boundaries of this column, but I didn\u2019t want to wait any longer to give it a further push.

Or at least that\u2019s what I concluded based on some googling, because I hadn\u2019t received any advance notice or warning. I had forgotten what an SSL is, had no idea when we implemented it, and was completely clueless about what I was supposed to do to fix the problem. I e-mailed our IT consultant, who I think must have implemented SSL for NCS years ago (I still haven\u2019t heard back from him). I also opened a support ticket with our security provider, because our web host told me they maintain the site\u2019s security certificate. I haven\u2019t heard back from them either \u2014 though late yesterday afternoon the scary browser warnings stopped, so I guess they remewed our certificate, but I really am still in the dark about the whole incident. Which means I\u2019m also in the dark about how to prevent this bullshit from happening again. Oh, and my cold was also in full bloom by late afternoon yesterday.

Born from the ashes of the thrash band Madsher , Exorcised have devoted their hellish energies to the creation of old school death thrash, taking their cues from such bands as Deicide , Morbid Angel , and Devastation . Today we have an example of the infernal sonic madness they\u2019ve created through our premiere of a lyuric video for a song from their debut full-length named \u201c Hatred Knife \u201c.

Following that up, guitarist/vocalist Pako Deimler decided to pay tribute to a personal favorite series from the \u201990s \u2014 The X-Files . More specifically, Deimler\u2019s new album, Darkness Falls , is based on one episode from the show\u2019s first season that itself was named \u201cDarkness Falls\u201d. That was a standalone episode in which Mulder and Scully went looking for a group of loggers missing in the Olympic National Forest in Washington State (which coincidentally isn\u2019t far from the HQ of our site), only to be confronted by a deadly form of mutant insects. Pako has said that he loves that episode in particular because of its \u201catmosphere\u201d but also because it\u2019s \u201cone of the few episodes where the main characters have a hard time and are truly in great danger.\u201d The new album is now set for release on March 20th by Awakening Records , and what we have for you today is the premiere of a lyric video for its second single \u2014 the title track \u201c Darkness Falls \u201c.
